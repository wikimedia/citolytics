        '''Elvis Aaron Presley'''{{refn|Although some pronounce [[Presley|his surname]] ['prɛzli] (PREZ-lee), Presley
        himself used the [[Southern American English]] pronunciation, ['prɛsli] (PRES-lee), as did his family and those
        who worked with him.{{sfn|Elster|2006|p=391}} The correct spelling of his middle name has long been a matter of
        debate. The physician who delivered him wrote "Elvis Aaron Presley" in his ledger.{{sfn|Nash|2005|p=11}} The
        state-issued birth certificate reads "Elvis Aron Presley". The name was chosen after the Presleys' friend and
        fellow congregation member Aaron Kennedy, though a single-A spelling was probably intended by Presley's parents
        in order to parallel the middle name of Presley's stillborn brother, Jesse Garon.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=13}} It
        reads Aron on most official documents produced during his lifetime, including his high school diploma, RCA
        record contract, and marriage license, and this was generally taken to be the proper
        spelling.{{sfn|Adelman|2002|pp=13–15}} In 1966, Presley expressed the desire to his father that the more
        traditional biblical rendering, Aaron, be used henceforth, "especially on legal
        documents".{{sfn|Nash|2005|p=11}} Five years later, the Jaycees citation honoring him as one of the country's
        Outstanding Young Men used Aaron. Late in his life, he sought to officially change the spelling to Aaron and
        discovered that state records already listed it that way. Knowing his wishes for his middle name, Aaron is the
        spelling his father chose for Presley's tombstone, and it is the spelling his estate has designated as
        official.{{sfn|Adelman|2002|pp=13–15}}|name=name|group=lower-alpha}} (January 8, 1935&nbsp;– August 16, 1977)
        was an American musician and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant [[Cultural impact of Elvis
        Presley|cultural icon]]s of the 20th century, he is often referred to as [[Honorific nicknames in popular
        music|"the King of Rock and Roll"]], or simply, "the King".

        Presley was born in [[Tupelo, Mississippi]], as a [[twinless twin]], and when he was 13 years old, he and his
        family relocated to [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. His music career began there in 1954, when he recorded a song with
        producer [[Sam Phillips]] at [[Sun Records]]. Accompanied by guitarist [[Scotty Moore]] and bassist [[Bill
        Black]], Presley was an early popularizer of [[rockabilly]], an uptempo, [[Backbeat (music)|backbeat]]-driven
        fusion of [[country music]] and [[rhythm and blues]]. [[RCA Victor]] acquired his contract in a deal arranged by
        [[Colonel Tom Parker]], who managed the singer for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single,
        "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. He was
        regarded as the leading figure of [[rock and roll]] after a series of successful network television appearances
        and chart-topping records. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style,
        combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines that coincided with the dawn of the
        [[Civil Rights Movement]], made him enormously popular—and controversial.

        In November 1956, he made his film debut in ''[[Love Me Tender (film)|Love Me Tender]]''. In 1958, he was
        drafted into military service. He resumed his recording career two years later, producing some of his most
        commercially successful work before devoting much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and their accompanying
        soundtrack albums, most of which were critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live
        performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed televised comeback special ''[[Elvis (1968 TV
        program)|Elvis]]'', which led to an extended [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] concert residency and a string of
        highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley was featured in the first globally broadcast concert via satellite,
        ''[[Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite|Aloha from Hawaii]]''. Several years of prescription drug abuse severely
        damaged his health, and he died in 1977 at the age of 42.

        long, has double-paned windows.|[[Elvis Presley Birthplace|Presley's birthplace]] in [[Tupelo, Mississippi]]]]
        Presley was born on January 8, 1935, in [[Tupelo, Mississippi]], the son of Gladys Love (née Smith; April 25,
        1912&nbsp;– August 14, 1958) and Vernon Elvis Presley (April 10, 1916&nbsp;– June 26,
        1979),{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=3}} in the two-room [[shotgun house]] built by Vernon's father in
        preparation for the child's birth. Jesse Garon Presley, his identical twin brother, was delivered
        [[stillbirth|stillborn]] 35 minutes before his own birth.

        As an only child, Presley became close to both parents and formed an especially close bond with his mother. The
        family attended an [[Assembly of God]], where he found his initial musical inspiration. Although he was in
        conflict with the [[Pentecostal]] church in his later years, he never officially left it.

        Rev. [[Rex Humbard]] officiated at his funeral, as Presley had been an admirer of Humbard's

        Presley's ancestry was primarily a Western European mix, including [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]],
        [[Scottish people|Scottish]],{{sfn|Dundy|2004|p=60}} [[Germans|German]],{{sfn|Kamphoefner|2009|p=33}} and some
        [[Normans|French Norman]]. Gladys's great-great-grandmother, Morning Dove White, was possibly a [[Cherokee]]
        Native American.<ref>{{cite
        web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-2007-07-25-voa66-66720472/560593.html|title=Southern Genealogy
        Yields Surprises|work=VOA}}</ref>{{sfn|Dundy|2004|pp=13, 16, 20–22, 26}}{{refn|According to a third cousin of
        Presley's, one of Gladys' great-grandmothers was Jewish.{{sfn|Dundy|2004|p=21}} There is no evidence that
        Presley or his mother shared this belief in a Jewish heritage. Syndicated columnist Nate Bloom has challenged
        the cousin's account, which he calls a "tall tale".{{sfn|Bloom|2010}}|name=jewish|group=lower-alpha}} Gladys was
        regarded by relatives and friends as the dominant member of the small family. Vernon moved from one odd job to
        the next, evincing little ambition.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=11–12, 23–24}}{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=419}} The family
        often relied on help from neighbors and government food assistance. The Presleys survived the F5 tornado in the
        [[1936 Tupelo–Gainesville tornado outbreak]]. In 1938, they lost their home after Vernon was found guilty of
        [[Check kiting|kiting a check]] written by the landowner, Orville S. Bean, the dairy farmer and cattle-and-hog
        broker for whom he then worked. He was jailed for eight months, and Gladys and Elvis moved in with
        relatives.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=12–14}}

        In September 1941, Presley entered first grade at East Tupelo Consolidated, where his instructors regarded him
        as "average".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=15–16}} He was encouraged to enter a singing contest after impressing his
        schoolteacher with a rendition of [[Red Foley]]'s [[country music|country]] song "[[Old Shep]]" during morning
        prayers. The contest, held at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show on October 3, 1945, was his first
        public performance: dressed as a cowboy, the ten-year-old Presley stood on a chair to reach the microphone and
        sang "Old Shep". He recalled placing fifth.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=17–18}} A few months later, Presley received
        his first guitar for his birthday; he had hoped for something else—by different accounts, either a bicycle or a
        rifle.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=19}}{{sfn|Dundy|2004|p=101}} Over the following year, he received basic guitar
        lessons from two of his uncles and the new pastor at the family's church. Presley recalled, "I took the guitar,
        and I watched people, and I learned to play a little bit. But I would never sing in public. I was very shy about
        it."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=23}}

        Entering a new school, Milam, for sixth grade in September 1946, Presley was regarded as a loner. The following
        year, he began bringing his guitar in on a daily basis. He played and sang during lunchtime, and was often
        teased as a "trashy" kid who played [[Hillbilly#Music|hillbilly]] music. The family was by then living in a
        largely African-American neighborhood.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=23–26}} A devotee of [[Mississippi Slim (country
        singer)|Mississippi Slim]]'s show on the Tupelo radio station [[WELO]], Presley was described as "crazy about
        music" by Slim's younger brother, a classmate of Presley's, who often took him into the station. Slim
        supplemented Presley's guitar tuition by demonstrating chord techniques.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=19–21}} When his
        protégé was 12 years old, Slim scheduled him for two on-air performances. Presley was overcome by stage fright
        the first time, but succeeded in performing the following week.{{sfn|Dundy|2004|pp=95–96}}

        ====Teenage life in Memphis====
        In November 1948, the family moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. After residing for nearly a year in [[boarding
        house|rooming houses]], they were granted a two-bedroom apartment in the [[Public housing in the United
        States|public housing]] complex known as the Lauderdale Courts.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=32–33}} Enrolled at
        [[Humes High School|L. C. Humes High School]], Presley received only a C in music in eighth grade. When his
        music teacher told him he had no aptitude for singing, he brought in his guitar the next day and sang a recent
        hit, "Keep Them Cold Icy Fingers Off Me", in an effort to prove otherwise. A classmate later recalled that the
        teacher "agreed that Elvis was right when he said that she didn't appreciate his kind of
        singing."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=36}} He was usually too shy to perform openly, and was occasionally bullied by
        classmates who viewed him as a "mama's boy".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=35–38}} In 1950, he began practicing guitar
        regularly under the tutelage of Jesse Lee Denson, a neighbor two-and-a-half years his senior. They and three
        other boys—including two future rockabilly pioneers, brothers [[Dorsey Burnette|Dorsey]] and [[Johnny
        Burnette]]—formed a loose musical collective that played frequently around the
        Courts.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=40–41}} That September, he began ushering at Loew's State
        Theater.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=20}} Other jobs followed, including Precision Tool, Loew's again, and MARL
        Metal Products.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=43, 44, 49}}

        During his junior year, Presley began to stand out more among his classmates, largely because of his appearance:
        he grew out his sideburns and styled his hair with rose oil and Vaseline. In his free time, he would head down
        to [[Beale Street]], the heart of Memphis's thriving [[blues]] scene, and gaze longingly at the wild, flashy
        clothes in the windows of [[Lansky Brothers]]. By his senior year, he was wearing
        them.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=44, 46, 51}} Overcoming his reticence about performing outside the Lauderdale
        Courts, he competed in Humes's Annual "Minstrel" show in April 1953. Singing and playing guitar, he opened with
        "[[Till I Waltz Again with You]]", a recent hit for [[Teresa Brewer]]. Presley recalled that the performance did
        much for his reputation: "I wasn't popular in school&nbsp;... I failed music—only thing I ever failed. And then
        they entered me in this talent show&nbsp;... when I came onstage I heard people kind of rumbling and whispering
        and so forth, 'cause nobody knew I even sang. It was amazing how popular I became after
        that."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=52–53}}

        Presley, who never received formal music training or learned to read music, studied and played by ear. He also
        frequented record stores with [[jukebox]]es and listening booths. He knew all of [[Hank Snow]]'s
        songs,{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=171}} and he loved records by other country singers such as [[Roy Acuff]], [[Ernest
        Tubb]], [[Ted Daffan]], [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Jimmie Davis]], and [[Bob
        Wills]].{{sfn|Matthew-Walker|1979|p=3}} The [[Southern gospel]] singer [[Jake Hess]], one of his favorite
        performers, was a significant influence on his ballad-singing style.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=46–48,
        358}}{{sfn|Wadey|2004}} He was a regular audience member at the monthly All-Night Singings downtown, where many

        (music)|spiritual music]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=47–48, 77–78}} He adored the music of black gospel singer
        [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]].{{sfn|Matthew-Walker|1979|p=3}} Like some of his peers, he may have attended blues
        venues—of necessity, in the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated South]], on only the nights
        designated for exclusively white audiences.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=51}} He certainly listened to the regional
        radio stations, such as WDIA-AM, that played "race records": spirituals, blues, and the modern, [[Backbeat
        (music)|backbeat]]-heavy sound of [[rhythm and blues]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=38–40}} Many of his future
        recordings were inspired by local African-American musicians such as [[Arthur Crudup]] and [[Rufus
        Thomas]].{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}}{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=205}} [[B.B. King]] recalled that he had known Presley
        before he was popular, when they both used to frequent Beale Street.{{sfn|Szatmary|1996|p=35}} By the time he
        graduated from high school in June 1953, Presley had already singled out music as his
        future.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=54}}{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=8}}

        ===1953–55: First recordings===

        ====Sam Phillips and Sun Records====
        {{see also|List of songs recorded by Elvis Presley on the Sun label}}
        [[File:PresleyPromo1954PhotoOnly.jpg|alt=Elvis in a tuxedo|thumb|Presley in a [[Sun Records]] promotional
        photograph, 1954]]
        In August 1953, Presley walked into the offices of [[Sun Records]]. He aimed to pay for a few minutes of studio
        time to record a two-sided [[acetate disc]]: "[[My Happiness (popular song)|My Happiness]]"{{sfn |Gilliland
        |1969 |loc=show 7, track 2}} and "That's When Your Heartaches Begin". He would later claim that he intended the
        record as a gift for his mother, or that he was merely interested in what he "sounded like", although there was
        a much cheaper, amateur record-making service at a nearby general store. Biographer [[Peter Guralnick]] argues
        that he chose Sun in the hope of being discovered. Asked by receptionist [[Marion Keisker]] what kind of singer
        he was, Presley responded, "I sing all kinds." When she pressed him on who he sounded like, he repeatedly
        answered, "I don't sound like nobody." After he recorded, Sun boss [[Sam Phillips]] asked Keisker to note down
        the young man's name, which she did along with her own commentary: "Good ballad singer.
        Hold."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=62–64}}

        In January 1954, Presley cut a second acetate at Sun Records—"I'll Never Stand In Your Way" and "It Wouldn't Be
        the Same Without You"—but again nothing came of it.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=65}} Not long after, he failed an
        audition for a local vocal quartet, the Songfellows. He explained to his father, "They told me I couldn't
        sing."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=77}} Songfellow [[Jim Hamill]] later claimed that he was turned down because he did
        not demonstrate an ear for harmony at the time.{{sfn|Cusic|1988|p=10}} In April, Presley began working for the
        Crown Electric company as a truck driver.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=80}} His friend Ronnie Smith, after playing a
        few local gigs with him, suggested he contact [[Eddie Bond]], leader of Smith's professional band, which had an
        opening for a vocalist. Bond rejected him after a tryout, advising Presley to stick to truck driving "because
        you're never going to make it as a singer".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=83}}

        Phillips, meanwhile, was always on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience the sound of
        the black musicians on whom Sun focused. As Keisker reported, "Over and over I remember Sam saying, 'If I could
        find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, I could make a billion
        dollars.'"{{sfn|Miller|2000|p=72}} In June, he acquired a demo recording of a ballad, "Without You", that he
        thought might suit the teenage singer. Presley came by the studio, but was unable to do it justice. Despite
        this, Phillips asked Presley to sing as many numbers as he knew. He was sufficiently affected by what he heard
        to invite two local musicians, guitarist [[Scotty Moore|Winfield "Scotty" Moore]] and [[double bass|upright
        bass]] player [[Bill Black]], to work something up with Presley for a recording
        session.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=10–11}}
        {{Listen |filename=That's All Right.ogg|title="That's All Right" |description=Presley transformed not only the
        sound but the emotion of the song, turning what had been written as a "lament for a lost love into a satisfied
        declaration of independence."{{sfn|Marcus|1982|p=174}}}}
        The session, held the evening of July 5, 1954, proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night. As they were
        about to give up and go home, Presley took his guitar and launched into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's
        "[[That's All Right]]". Moore recalled, "All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around
        and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started
        playing with them. Sam, I think, had the door to the control booth open&nbsp;... he stuck his head out and said,
        'What are you doing?' And we said, 'We don't know.' 'Well, back up,' he said, 'try to find a place to start, and
        do it again.'" Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking
        for.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=94–97}} Three days later, popular Memphis DJ [[Dewey Phillips]] played "That's All
        Right" on his ''Red, Hot, and Blue'' show.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=43}} Listeners began phoning in, eager to
        find out who the singer was. The interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the last
        two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended in order to
        clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed he was black.{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=show 7, track
        2}}{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=100–01}} During the next few days, the trio recorded a [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]]
        number, [[Bill Monroe]]'s "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]", again in a distinctive style and employing a jury-rigged
        [[Delay (audio effect)|echo effect]] that Sam Phillips dubbed "slapback". A single was pressed with "That's All
        Right" on the A side and "Blue Moon of Kentucky" on the reverse.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=102–04}}

        ====Early live performances and signing with RCA====
        The trio played publicly for the first time on July 17 at the Bon Air club—Presley still sporting his child-size
        guitar.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=105, 139}} At the end of the month, they appeared at the [[Overton Park#Levitt
        Shell|Overton Park Shell]], with [[Slim Whitman]] headlining. A combination of his strong response to rhythm and
        nervousness at playing before a large crowd led Presley to shake his legs as he performed: his wide-cut pants
        emphasized his movements, causing young women in the audience to start screaming.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=106,
        108–11}} Moore recalled, "During the instrumental parts, he would back off from the mike and be playing and
        shaking, and the crowd would just go wild".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=110}} Black, a natural showman, whooped and
        rode his bass, hitting double licks that Presley would later remember as "really a wild sound, like a jungle
        drum or something".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=110}}
        Soon after, Moore and Black quit their old band to play with Presley regularly, and DJ and promoter Bob Neal
        became the trio's manager. From August through October, they played frequently at the Eagle's Nest club and
        returned to Sun Studio for more recording sessions,{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=117–27, 131}} and Presley quickly
        grew more confident on stage. According to Moore, "His movement was a natural thing, but he was also very
        conscious of what got a reaction. He'd do something one time and then he would expand on it real
        quick."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=119}} Presley made what would be his only appearance on [[Nashville,
        Tennessee|Nashville]]'s ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' on October 2; after a polite audience response, ''Opry'' manager
        Jim Denny told Phillips that his singer was "not bad" but did not suit the
        program.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=128–30}}{{sfn|Mason|2007|pp=37-38}} Two weeks later, Presley was booked on
        ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'', the ''Opry''{{'}}s chief, and more adventurous, rival. The [[Shreveport,
        Louisiana|Shreveport]]-based show was broadcast to 198 radio stations in 28 states. Presley had another attack
        of nerves during the first set, which drew a muted reaction. A more composed and energetic second set inspired
        an enthusiastic response.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=127–28, 135–42}} House drummer [[D. J. Fontana]] brought a new
        element, complementing Presley's movements with accented beats that he had mastered playing in strip
        clubs.{{sfn|Burke|Griffin|2006|pp=61, 176}} Soon after the show, the ''Hayride'' engaged Presley for a year's
        worth of Saturday-night appearances. Trading in his old guitar for $8 (and seeing it promptly dispatched to the
        garbage), he purchased a [[C. F. Martin & Company|Martin]] instrument for $175, and his trio began playing in
        new locales including [[Houston, Texas]], and [[Texarkana, Arkansas]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=152, 156, 182}}

        By early 1955, Presley's regular ''Hayride'' appearances, constant touring, and well-received record releases
        had made him a regional star, from Tennessee to West Texas. In January, Neal signed a formal management contract
        with Presley and brought the singer to the attention of [[Colonel Tom Parker]], whom he considered the best
        promoter in the music business. Having successfully managed top country star [[Eddy Arnold]], Parker was now
        working with the new number-one country singer, Hank Snow. Parker booked Presley on Snow's February
        tour.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=144, 159, 167–68}}{{sfn|Nash|2003|pp=6–12}} When the tour reached [[Odessa,
        Texas|Odessa]], Texas, a 19-year-old [[Roy Orbison]] saw Presley for the first time: "His energy was incredible,
        his instinct was just amazing.&nbsp;... I just didn't know what to make of it. There was just no reference point
        in the culture to compare it."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=171}} Presley made his television debut on March 3 on the
        [[KSLA-TV]] broadcast of ''Louisiana Hayride''. Soon after, he failed an audition for ''[[Arthur Godfrey's
        Talent Scouts]]'' on the [[CBS]] television network. By August, Sun had released ten sides credited to "Elvis
        Presley, Scotty and Bill"; on the latest recordings, the trio were joined by a drummer. Some of the songs, like
        "That's All Right", were in what one Memphis journalist described as the "R&B idiom of negro field jazz";
        others, like "Blue Moon of Kentucky", were "more in the country field", "but there was a curious blending of the
        two different musics in both".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=163}} This blend of styles made it difficult for Presley's
        music to find radio airplay. According to Neal, many country-music disc jockeys would not play it because he
        sounded too much like a black artist and none of the rhythm-and-blues stations would touch him because "he
        sounded too much like a hillbilly."{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=104}} The blend came to be known as [[rockabilly]]. At
        the time, Presley was variously billed as "The King of Western Bop", "The Hillbilly Cat", and "The Memphis
        Flash".{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=53}}

        Presley renewed Neal's management contract in August 1955, simultaneously appointing Parker as his special
        adviser.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=45}} The group maintained an extensive touring schedule throughout the
        second half of the year.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=29}} Neal recalled, "It was almost frightening, the reaction that
        came to Elvis from the teenaged boys. So many of them, through some sort of jealousy, would practically hate
        him. There were occasions in some towns in Texas when we'd have to be sure to have a police guard because
        somebody'd always try to take a crack at him. They'd get a gang and try to waylay him or
        something."{{sfn|Rogers|1982|p=41}} The trio became a quartet when ''Hayride'' drummer Fontana joined as a full
        member. In mid-October, they played a few shows in support of [[Bill Haley]], whose "[[Rock Around the Clock]]"
        had been a number-one hit the previous year. Haley observed that Presley had a natural feel for rhythm, and
        advised him to sing fewer ballads.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=217–19}}

        At the Country Disc Jockey Convention in early November, Presley was voted the year's most promising male
        artist.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=31}} Several record companies had by now shown interest in signing him. After
        three major labels made offers of up to $25,000, Parker and Phillips struck a deal with [[RCA Records|RCA
        Victor]] on November 21 to acquire Presley's Sun contract for an unprecedented
        $40,000.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|pp=28–29}}{{refn|Of the $40,000, $5,000 covered back royalties owed by

        so his father signed the contract.{{sfn|Escott|1998|p=421}} Parker arranged with the owners of [[Hill and
        Range]] Publishing, [[Jean Aberbach|Jean]] and [[Julian Aberbach]], to create two entities, Elvis Presley Music
        and Gladys Music, to handle all the new material recorded by Presley. Songwriters were obliged to forgo one
        third of their customary royalties in exchange for having him perform their
        compositions.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=36, 54}}{{refn|In 1956–57, Presley was also credited as a cowriter on
        several songs where he had no hand in the writing process: "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]"; "[[Don't Be Cruel]]"; all

        "[[Paralyzed (Elvis Presley song)|Paralyzed]]"; and "[[All Shook Up]]".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=35, 51, 57, 61,
        75}} (Parker, however, failed to register Presley with such musical licensing firms as [[ASCAP]] and/or its
        rival [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]], which eventually denied Presley annuity from songwriter's royalties.) He
        received credit on two other songs to which he did contribute: he provided the title for "[[That's Someone You
        Never Forget]]" (1961), written by his friend and former Humes schoolmate [[Red West]]; Presley and West
        collaborated with another friend, guitarist Charlie Hodge, on "[[You'll Be Gone]]"
        (1962).{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=157–58, 166, 168}}|name=cowriter|group=lower-alpha}} By December, RCA had begun

        guitar|Publicity photo for the CBS program ''Stage Show'', January 16, 1956]]
        On January 10, 1956, Presley made his first recordings for RCA in Nashville.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=30}}
        Extending the singer's by now customary backup of Moore, Black, and Fontana, RCA enlisted pianist [[Floyd
        Cramer]], guitarist [[Chet Atkins]], and three background singers, including first tenor Gordon Stoker of the
        popular [[Jordanaires]] quartet, to fill out the sound.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=235–36}} The session produced the
        moody, unusual "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]", released as a single on January 27.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=30}}
        Parker finally brought Presley to national television, booking him on CBS's ''[[Stage Show (TV series)|Stage
        Show]]'' for six appearances over two months. The program, produced in New York, was hosted on alternate weeks
        by big band leaders and brothers [[Tommy Dorsey|Tommy]] and [[Jimmy Dorsey]]. After his first appearance, on
        January 28, introduced by disc jockey [[Bill Randle]], Presley stayed in town to record at RCA's New York
        studio. The sessions yielded eight songs, including a cover of [[Carl Perkins]]' rockabilly anthem "[[Blue Suede
        Shoes]]". In February, Presley's "[[I Forgot to Remember to Forget]]", a Sun recording initially released the
        previous August, reached the top of the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' country
        chart]].{{sfn|Slaughter|Nixon|2004|p=21}} Neal's contract was terminated and, on March 2, Parker became
        Presley's manager.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=50, 54, 64}}

        RCA Victor released Presley's [[Elvis Presley (album)|eponymous debut album]] on March 23. Joined by five
        previously unreleased Sun recordings, its seven recently recorded tracks were of a broad variety. There were two
        country songs and a bouncy pop tune. The others would centrally define the evolving sound of [[rock and roll]]:
        "Blue Suede Shoes"—"an improvement over Perkins' in almost every way", according to critic [[Robert
        Hilburn]]—and three R&B numbers that had been part of Presley's stage repertoire for some time, covers of
        [[Little Richard]],{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=show 7, track 2}} [[Ray Charles]], and [[The Drifters]]. As
        described by Hilburn, these "were the most revealing of all. Unlike many white artists&nbsp;... who watered down
        the gritty edges of the original R&B versions of songs in the '50s, Presley reshaped them. He not only injected
        the tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar, not piano, the lead instrument in all three
        cases."{{sfn|Hilburn|2005}} It became the first rock-and-roll album to top the ''Billboard'' chart, a position
        it held for 10 weeks.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=30}} While Presley was not an innovative guitarist like Moore
        or contemporary African American rockers [[Bo Diddley]] and [[Chuck Berry]], cultural historian Gilbert B.
        Rodman argues that the album's cover image, "of Elvis having the time of his life on stage ''with a guitar in
        his hands'' played a crucial role in positioning the guitar&nbsp;... as the instrument that best captured the
        style and spirit of this new music."{{sfn|Rodman|1996|p=28}}

        ====''Milton Berle Show'' and "Hound Dog"====
        Presley made the first of two appearances on NBC's ''[[The Milton Berle Show|Milton Berle Show]]'' on April 3.
        His performance, on the deck of the [[USS Hancock (CV-19)|USS ''Hancock'']] in [[San Diego]], prompted cheers
        and screams from an audience of sailors and their dates.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=262–63}} A few days later, a
        flight taking Presley and his band to Nashville for a recording session left all three badly shaken when an
        engine died and the plane almost went down over Arkansas.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=267}} Twelve weeks after its
        original release, "Heartbreak Hotel" became Presley's first number-one pop hit. In late April, Presley began a
        two-week residency at the [[New Frontier Hotel and Casino]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]]. The shows were poorly
        received by the conservative, middle-aged hotel guests{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 7, track 4}}—"like a jug of
        corn liquor at a champagne party," wrote a critic for ''[[Newsweek]].''{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=274}} Amid his
        Vegas tenure, Presley, who had serious acting ambitions, signed a seven-year contract with [[Paramount
        Pictures]].{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=315}} He began a tour of the Midwest in mid-May, taking in 15 cities in as many
        days.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=72–73}} He had attended several shows by [[Freddie Bell and the
        Bellboys]] in Vegas and was struck by their cover of "[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]", a hit in 1953 for blues
        singer [[Big Mama Thornton]] by songwriters [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller]].{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 7,
        track 4}} It became the new closing number of his act.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=273, 284}} After a show in [[La
        Crosse, Wisconsin]], an urgent message on the letterhead of the local Catholic diocese's newspaper was sent to
        [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] director [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. It warned that "Presley is a definite
        danger to the security of the United States.&nbsp;... [His] actions and motions were such as to rouse the sexual
        passions of teenaged youth.&nbsp;... After the show, more than 1,000 teenagers tried to gang into Presley's room
        at the auditorium.&nbsp;... Indications of the harm Presley did just in La Crosse were the two high school girls&nbsp;...
        whose abdomen and thigh had Presley's autograph."{{sfn|Fensch|2001|pp=14–18}}

        The second ''Milton Berle Show'' appearance came on June 5 at NBC's Hollywood studio, amid another hectic tour.
        Berle persuaded the singer to leave his guitar backstage, advising, "Let 'em see you,
        son."{{sfn|Burke|Griffin|2006|p=52}} During the performance, Presley abruptly halted an uptempo rendition of
        "Hound Dog" with a wave of his arm and launched into a slow, grinding version accentuated with energetic,
        exaggerated body movements.{{sfn|Burke|Griffin|2006|p=52}} Presley's gyrations created a storm of
        controversy.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=49}} Newspaper critics were outraged: [[Jack Gould]] of ''[[The New York
        Times]]'' wrote, "Mr. Presley has no discernible singing ability.&nbsp;... His phrasing, if it can be called
        that, consists of the stereotyped variations that go with a beginner's aria in a bathtub.&nbsp;... His one
        specialty is an accented movement of the body&nbsp;... primarily identified with the repertoire of the blond
        bombshells of the burlesque runway."{{sfn|Gould|1956}} Ben Gross of the New York ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily
        News]]'' opined that popular music "has reached its lowest depths in the 'grunt and groin' antics of one Elvis
        Presley.&nbsp;... Elvis, who rotates his pelvis&nbsp;... gave an exhibition that was suggestive and vulgar,
        tinged with the kind of animalism that should be confined to dives and
        bordellos".{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=73}} [[Ed Sullivan]], whose own variety show was the nation's most
        popular, declared him "unfit for family viewing".{{sfn|Marcus|2006}} To Presley's displeasure, he soon found
        himself being referred to as "Elvis the Pelvis", which he called "one of the most childish expressions I ever
        heard, comin' from an adult."{{sfn|Marsh|1982|p=100}}

        ====''Steve Allen Show'' and first Sullivan appearance====
        [[File:Elvis Presley and Ed Sullivan October 1956.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of Elvis and Ed Sullivan|Ed Sullivan and
        Presley during rehearsals for his second appearance on the ''Ed Sullivan Show'', October 26, 1956]]
        The Berle shows drew such high ratings that Presley was booked for a July 1 appearance on NBC's ''[[The Steve
        Allen Show|Steve Allen Show]]'' in New York. Allen, no fan of rock and roll, introduced a "new Elvis" in a white
        bow tie and black tails. Presley sang "Hound Dog" for less than a minute to a [[basset hound]] wearing a top hat
        and bow tie. As described by television historian Jake Austen, "Allen thought Presley was talentless and absurd&nbsp;...
        [he] set things up so that Presley would show his contrition".{{sfn|Austen|2005|p=13}} Allen, for his part,
        later wrote that he found Presley's "strange, gangly, country-boy charisma, his hard-to-define cuteness, and his
        charming eccentricity intriguing" and simply worked the singer into the customary "comedy fabric" of his
        program.{{sfn|Allen|1992|p=270}} Just before the final rehearsal for the show, Presley told a reporter, "I'm
        holding down on this show. I don't want to do anything to make people dislike me. I think TV is important so I'm
        going to go along, but I won't be able to give the kind of show I do in a personal appearance."{{sfn|Rock 'N
        Roll Stars|1956}} Presley would refer back to the Allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his
        career.{{sfn|Keogh|2004|p=73}} Later that night, he appeared on ''[[Hy Gardner Calling]]'', a popular local TV
        show. Pressed on whether he had learned anything from the criticism to which he was being subjected, Presley
        responded, "No, I haven't, I don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong.&nbsp;... I don't see how any type of
        music would have any bad influence on people when it's only music.&nbsp;... I mean, how would rock 'n' roll
        music make anyone rebel against their parents?"{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=73}}

        [[File:Elvis Presley and the Jordanaires 1957.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photo of Elvis and the Jordanaires|Presley with
        his backup group, the Jordanaires, March 1957]]
        The next day, Presley recorded "Hound Dog", along with "[[Any Way You Want Me (That's How I Will Be)|Any Way You
        Want Me]]" and "[[Don't Be Cruel]]". [[The Jordanaires]] sang harmony, as they had on ''The Steve Allen Show'';
        they would work with Presley through the 1960s. A few days later, the singer made an outdoor concert appearance
        in Memphis at which he announced, "You know, those people in New York are not gonna change me none. I'm gonna
        show you what the real Elvis is like tonight."{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=51}} In August, a judge in [[Jacksonville,
        Florida]], ordered Presley to tame his act. Throughout the following performance, he largely kept still, except
        for wiggling his little finger suggestively in mockery of the order.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=80–81}}
        The single pairing "Don't Be Cruel" with "Hound Dog" ruled the top of the charts for 11 weeks—a mark that would
        not be surpassed for 36 years.{{sfn|Whitburn|1993|p=5}} Recording sessions for Presley's second album took place
        in Hollywood during the first week of September. Leiber and Stoller, the writers of "Hound Dog," contributed
        "[[Love Me (Leiber/Stoller song)|Love Me]]."{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 7, track
        4}}{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=60–65}}

        Allen's show with Presley had, for the first time, beaten CBS's ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show|Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in
        the ratings. Sullivan, despite his June pronouncement, booked the singer for three appearances for an
        unprecedented $50,000.{{sfn|Austen|2005|p=16}}{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 7, track 4}} The first, on September
        9, 1956, was seen by approximately 60 million viewers—a record 82.6 percent of the television
        audience.{{sfn|Edgerton|2007|p=187}} Actor [[Charles Laughton]] hosted the show, filling in while Sullivan
        recuperated from a car accident.{{sfn|Marcus|2006}} Presley appeared in two segments that night from [[CBS
        Television City]] in Los Angeles. According to Elvis legend, Presley was shot from only the waist
        up.{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 7, track 4}} Watching clips of the Allen and Berle shows with his producer,
        Sullivan had opined that Presley "got some kind of device hanging down below the crotch of his pants–so when he
        moves his legs back and forth you can see the outline of his cock.&nbsp;... I think it's a Coke bottle.&nbsp;...
        We just can't have this on a Sunday night. This is a family show!"{{sfn|Brown|Broeske|1997|p=93}} Sullivan
        publicly told ''[[TV Guide]]'', "As for his gyrations, the whole thing can be controlled with camera
        shots."{{sfn|Austen|2005|p=16}} In fact, Presley was shown head-to-toe in the first and second shows. Though the
        camerawork was relatively discreet during his debut, with leg-concealing closeups when he danced, the studio
        audience reacted in customary style: screaming.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=338}}{{sfn|Gibson|2005}} Presley's
        performance of his forthcoming single, the ballad "[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]", prompted a
        record-shattering million advance orders.{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=439}} More than any other single event, it was this
        first appearance on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' that made Presley a national celebrity of barely precedented
        proportions.{{sfn|Marcus|2006}}

        Accompanying Presley's rise to fame, a cultural shift was taking place that he both helped inspire and came to
        symbolize. Igniting the "biggest pop craze since [[Glenn Miller]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]&nbsp;... Presley brought
        rock'n'roll into the mainstream of popular culture", writes historian Marty Jezer. "As Presley set the artistic
        pace, other artists followed.&nbsp;... Presley, more than anyone else, gave the young a belief in themselves as
        a distinct and somehow unified generation—the first in America ever to feel the power of an integrated youth
        culture."{{sfn|Jezer|1982|p=281}}

        ====Crazed crowds and film debut====

        appearance, he introduces one of his signature numbers.}}
        The audience response at Presley's live shows became increasingly fevered. Moore recalled, "He'd start out, 'You
        ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog,' and they'd just go to pieces. They'd always react the same way. There'd be a
        riot every time."{{sfn|Moore|Dickerson|1997|p=175}} At the two concerts he performed in September at the
        Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show, 50 [[National Guard of the United States|National Guardsmen]] were
        added to the police security to prevent crowd trouble.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=343}} ''[[Elvis (1956
        album)|Elvis]]'', Presley's second album, was released in October and quickly rose to number one. The album
        includes "Old Shep", which he sang at the talent show in 1945, and which now marked the first time he played
        piano on an RCA session. According to Guralnick, one can hear "in the halting chords and the somewhat stumbling
        rhythm both the unmistakable emotion and the equally unmistakable valuing of emotion over
        technique."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=335}} Assessing the musical and cultural impact of Presley's recordings from
        "That's All Right" through ''Elvis'', rock critic [[Dave Marsh]] wrote that "these records, more than any
        others, contain the seeds of what rock & roll was, has been and most likely what it may foreseeably
        become."{{sfn|Marsh|1980|p=395}}

        Presley returned to the Sullivan show at its main studio in New York, hosted this time by its namesake, on
        October 28. After the performance, crowds in Nashville and St. Louis burned him in effigy.{{sfn|Marcus|2006}}
        His first motion picture, ''[[Love Me Tender (film)|Love Me Tender]]'', was released on November 21. Though he
        was not top billed, the film's original title—''[[Reno Gang|The Reno Brothers]]''—was changed to capitalize on
        his latest number one record: "Love Me Tender" had hit the top of the charts earlier that month. To further take
        advantage of Presley's popularity, four musical numbers were added to what was originally a straight acting
        role. The film was panned by the critics but did very well at the box office.{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=315}}

        On December 4, Presley dropped into Sun Records where Carl Perkins and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] were recording and
        [[Jam session|jammed]] with them. Though Phillips no longer had the right to release any Presley material, he
        made sure the session was captured on tape. The results became legendary as the "[[Million Dollar Quartet]]"
        recordings—[[Johnny Cash]] was long thought to have played as well, but he was present only briefly at Phillips'
        instigation for a photo opportunity.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=71}} The year ended with a front-page story in
        ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reporting that Presley merchandise had brought in $22 million on top of his
        record sales,{{sfn|Palladino|1996|p=131}} and ''Billboard''{{'}}s declaration that he had placed more songs in
        the top 100 than any other artist since records were first charted.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=37}} In his first
        full year at RCA, one of the music industry's largest companies, Presley had accounted for over 50 percent of
        the label's singles sales.{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=439}}

        ====Leiber and Stoller collaboration and draft notice====
        Presley made his third and final ''Ed Sullivan Show'' appearance on January 6, 1957—on this occasion indeed shot
        only down to the waist. Some commentators have claimed that Parker orchestrated an appearance of censorship to
        generate publicity.{{sfn|Gibson|2005}}{{sfn|Clayton|Heard|2003|pp=117–18}} In any event, as critic [[Greil
        Marcus]] describes, Presley "did not tie himself down. Leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn on the first
        two shows, he stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha, if not a harem girl. From the make-up over his
        eyes, the hair falling in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing [[Rudolph
        Valentino]] in ''[[The Sheik (film)|The Sheik]]'', with all stops out."{{sfn|Marcus|2006}} To close, displaying
        his range and defying Sullivan's wishes, Presley sang a gentle black spiritual, "[[Peace in the Valley]]". At
        the end of the show, Sullivan declared Presley "a real decent, fine boy".{{sfn|Keogh|2004|p=90}}
        Two days later, the Memphis [[Conscription in the United States|draft board]] announced that Presley would be
        [[class 1-A|classified 1-A]] and would probably be drafted sometime that
        year.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=95}}

        Each of the three Presley singles released in the first half of 1957 went to number one: "[[Too Much (Elvis
        Presley song)|Too Much]]", "[[All Shook Up]]", and "[[(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear]]". Already an international
        star, he was attracting fans even where his music was not officially released. Under the headline "Presley
        Records a Craze in Soviet", ''The New York Times'' reported that pressings of his music on discarded X-ray
        plates were commanding high prices in Leningrad.{{sfn|Salisbury|1957|p=4}} Between film shoots and recording
        sessions, the singer also found time to purchase an 18-room mansion eight miles (13&nbsp;km) south of downtown
        Memphis for himself and his parents: [[Graceland]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=395–97}} When he reported to the film
        studio for his second film, the Technicolor ''[[Loving You (1957 film)|Loving You]]'', released in July, "The
        makeup man said that with his eyes he should photograph well with black hair, so they dyed
        it."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=388}} ''[[Loving You (album)|Loving You]]'', the accompanying soundtrack, was
        Presley's third straight number one album. The title track was written by Leiber and Stoller, who were then
        retained to write four of the six songs recorded at the sessions for ''[[Jailhouse Rock (film)|Jailhouse
        Rock]]'', Presley's next film. The songwriting team effectively produced the ''Jailhouse'' sessions and
        developed a close working relationship with Presley, who came to regard them as his "good-luck
        charm".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=406–08, 452}}

        Leiber remembered initially finding Presley "not quite authentic—after all, he was a white singer, and my
        standards were black."{{sfn|Fox|1986|p=178}} According to Stoller, the duo was "surprised at the kind of
        knowledge that he had about black music. We figured that he had these remarkable pipes and all that, but we
        didn't realize that he knew so much about the blues. We were quite surprised to find out that he knew as much
        about it as we did. He certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel
        music."{{sfn|Fox|1986|p=179}} Leiber remembered the recording process with Presley, "He was fast. Any demo you
        gave him he knew by heart in ten minutes." {{sfn|Fox|1986|p=178}} As Stoller recalled, Presley "was 'protected'"
        by his manager and entourage. "He was removed. … They kept him separate."{{sfn|Fox|1986|p=179}}

        Presley undertook three brief tours during the year, continuing to generate a crazed audience
        response.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=399–402, 428–30, 437–40}} A Detroit newspaper suggested that "the trouble with
        going to see Elvis Presley is that you're liable to get killed."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=400}} [[Villanova
        University|Villanova]] students pelted him with eggs in Philadelphia,{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=400}} and in
        Vancouver, the crowd rioted after the end of the show, destroying the stage.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=430}} Frank
        Sinatra, who had famously inspired the swooning of teenaged girls in the 1940s, condemned the new musical
        phenomenon. In a magazine article, he decried rock and roll as "brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious.&nbsp;... It
        fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is
        sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons.&nbsp;... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I
        deplore."{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=104}} Asked for a response, Presley said, "I admire the man. He has a right to say
        what he wants to say. He is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it.&nbsp;...
        This is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=437}}

        Hart in the film ''King Creole''|Presley and Dolores Hart in ''King Creole'', 1958]]
        Leiber and Stoller were again in the studio for the recording of ''[[Elvis' Christmas Album]]''. Toward the end
        of the session, they wrote a song on the spot at Presley's request: "Santa Claus Is Back In Town", an
        innuendo-laden blues.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=431}} The holiday release stretched Presley's string of number one
        albums to four and would eventually become the [[List of best-selling Christmas/holiday albums in the United
        States|best selling Christmas album of all time]].{{sfn|Freierman|2008}}{{sfn|Grein|2008}} After the session,
        Moore and Black—drawing only modest weekly salaries, sharing in none of Presley's massive financial
        success—resigned. Though they were brought back on a per diem basis a few weeks later, it was clear that they
        had not been part of Presley's inner circle for some time.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=431–35}} On December 20,
        Presley received his draft notice. He was granted a deferment to finish the forthcoming ''[[King Creole]]'', in
        which $350,000 had already been invested by Paramount and producer [[Hal Wallis]]. A couple of weeks into the
        new year, "[[Don't (Elvis Presley song)|Don't]]", another Leiber and Stoller tune, became Presley's tenth number
        one seller. It had been only 21 months since "Heartbreak Hotel" had brought him to the top for the first time.
        Recording sessions for the [[King Creole#Soundtrack|''King Creole'' soundtrack]] were held in Hollywood
        mid-January. Leiber and Stoller provided three songs and were again on hand, but it would be the last time they
        worked closely with Presley.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=448–49}} A studio session on February 1 marked another
        ending: it was the final occasion on which Black was to perform with Presley. He died in 1965.

        On March 24, Presley was inducted into the U.S. Army as a private at [[Fort Chaffee]], near [[Fort Smith,
        Arkansas]]. His arrival was a major media event. Hundreds of people descended on Presley as he stepped from the
        bus; photographers then accompanied him into the fort.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=461–74}} Presley announced that he
        was looking forward to his military stint, saying he did not want to be treated any differently from anyone
        else: "The Army can do anything it wants with me."{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=27}}

        Soon after Presley commenced basic training at [[Fort Hood]], Texas, he received a visit from Eddie Fadal, a
        businessman he had met on tour. According to Fadal, Presley had become convinced his career was finished—"He
        firmly believed that."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=466–67}} But then, during a two-week [[Leave (military)|leave]] in
        early June, Presley recorded five songs in Nashville.

        In early August, his mother was diagnosed with hepatitis and her condition rapidly worsened. Presley, granted
        emergency leave to visit her, arrived in Memphis on August 12. Two days later, she died of heart failure, aged
        46. Presley was devastated;{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=474–80}} their relationship had remained extremely close—even
        into his adulthood, they would use baby talk with each other and Presley would address her with pet
        names.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=13}}

        [[File:Elvis with parents 1958.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Presley with his parents upon Army induction]]
        After training, Presley joined the [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]] in [[Friedberg,
        Hesse|Friedberg]], Germany, on October 1.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=115}} Introduced to amphetamines by a
        sergeant while on maneuvers, he became "practically evangelical about their benefits"—not only for energy, but
        for "strength" and weight loss, as well—and many of his friends in the outfit joined him in
        indulging.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=21}} The Army also introduced Presley to karate, which he studied seriously,
        later including it in his live performances.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=47, 49, 55, 60, 73}} Fellow soldiers have
        attested to Presley's wish to be seen as an able, ordinary soldier, despite his fame, and to his generosity. He
        donated his Army pay to charity, purchased TV sets for the base, and bought an extra set of fatigues for
        everyone in his outfit.{{sfn|Clayton|Heard|2003|p=160}}

        While in Friedberg, Presley met 14-year-old [[Priscilla Presley|Priscilla Beaulieu]]. They would eventually
        marry after a seven-and-a-half-year courtship.{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=415}} In her autobiography, Priscilla says
        that despite his worries that it would ruin his career, Parker convinced Presley that to gain popular respect,
        he should serve his country as a regular soldier rather than in Special Services, where he would have been able
        to give some musical performances and remain in touch with the public.{{sfn|Presley|1985|p=40}} Media reports
        echoed Presley's concerns about his career, but RCA producer [[Stephen H. Sholes|Steve Sholes]] and [[Freddy
        Bienstock]] of Hill and Range had carefully prepared for his two-year hiatus. Armed with a substantial amount of
        unreleased material, they kept up a regular stream of successful releases.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=107}} Between
        his induction and discharge, Presley had ten top 40 hits, including "[[Wear My Ring Around Your Neck]]", the

        studio]] to cut tracks for a new album along with a single, "[[Stuck on You (Elvis Presley song)|Stuck on
        You]]", which was rushed into release and swiftly became a number one hit.{{sfn|Slaughter|Nixon|2004|p=57}}
        Another Nashville session two weeks later yielded a pair of his best-selling singles, the ballads "[[It's Now or
        Never (song)|It's Now or Never]]" and "[[Are You Lonesome Tonight? (song)|Are You Lonesome
        Tonight?]]",{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 8, track 5}} along with the rest of ''[[Elvis Is Back!]]'' The album
        features several songs described by Greil Marcus as full of [[Chicago blues]] "menace, driven by Presley's own
        super-miked acoustic guitar, brilliant playing by Scotty Moore, and demonic sax work from [[Boots Randolph]].
        Elvis's singing wasn't sexy, it was pornographic."{{sfn|Marcus|1982|pp=279–80}} As a whole, the record "conjured
        up the vision of a performer who could be all things", in the words of music historian John Robertson: "a
        flirtatious teenage idol with a heart of gold; a tempestuous, dangerous lover; a gutbucket blues singer; a
        sophisticated nightclub entertainer; [a] raucous rocker".{{sfn|Robertson|2004|p=50}}

        Presley returned to television on May 12 as a guest on ''[[The Frank Sinatra Timex Show: Welcome Home Elvis|The
        Frank Sinatra Timex Special]]''—ironic for both stars, given Sinatra's not-so-distant excoriation of rock and
        roll. Also known as ''Welcome Home Elvis'', the show had been taped in late March, the only time all year
        Presley performed in front of an audience. Parker secured an unheard-of $125,000 fee for eight minutes of
        singing. The broadcast drew an enormous viewership.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=44, 62–63}}

        ''[[G.I. Blues (album)|G.I. Blues]]'', the soundtrack to Presley's first film since his return, was a number one
        album in October. His first LP of sacred material, ''[[His Hand in Mine]]'', followed two months later. It
        reached number 13 on the U.S. pop chart and number 3 in the UK, remarkable figures for a gospel album. In
        February 1961, Presley performed two shows for a benefit event in Memphis, on behalf of 24 local charities.
        During a luncheon preceding the event, RCA presented him with a plaque certifying worldwide sales of over 75
        million records.{{sfn|Gordon|2005|pp=110, 114}} A 12-hour Nashville session in mid-March yielded nearly all of
        Presley's next studio album, ''[[Something for Everybody]]''.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=148}} As described by John
        Robertson, it exemplifies the [[Nashville sound]], the restrained, cosmopolitan style that would define country
        music in the 1960s. Presaging much of what was to come from Presley himself over the next half-decade, the album
        is largely "a pleasant, unthreatening pastiche of the music that had once been Elvis's
        birthright."{{sfn|Robertson|2004|p=52}} It would be his sixth number one LP. Another benefit concert, raising
        money for a [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] memorial, was staged on March 25, in Hawaii. It was to be
        Presley's last public performance for seven years.{{sfn|Gordon|2005|pp=110, 119}}

        ====Lost in Hollywood====
        [[File:Elvis Presley Wedding Photo 1967.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of Elvis Presley kissing his new bride

        [[Las Vegas]]]]
        Parker had by now pushed Presley into a heavy film making schedule, focused on formulaic, modestly budgeted
        musical comedies. Presley at first insisted on pursuing more serious roles, but when two films in a more
        dramatic vein—''[[Flaming Star]]'' (1960) and ''[[Wild in the Country]]'' (1961)—were less commercially
        successful, he reverted to the formula. Among the 27 films he made during the 1960s, there were few further
        exceptions.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=133}} His films were almost universally panned; critic Andrew Caine
        dismissed them as a "pantheon of bad taste".{{sfn|Caine|2005|p=21}} Nonetheless, they were virtually all
        profitable. [[Hal Wallis]], who produced nine of them, declared, "A Presley picture is the only sure thing in
        Hollywood."{{sfn|Fields|2007}}

        Of Presley's films in the 1960s, 15 were accompanied by soundtrack albums and another 5 by soundtrack EPs. The
        films' rapid production and release schedules—he frequently starred in three a year—affected his music.
        According to Jerry Leiber, the soundtrack formula was already evident before Presley left for the Army: "three
        ballads, one medium-tempo [number], one up-tempo, and one break blues boogie".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=449}} As
        the decade wore on, the quality of the soundtrack songs grew "progressively
        worse".{{sfn|Kirchberg|Hendrickx|1999|p=67}} [[Julie Parrish]], who appeared in ''[[Paradise, Hawaiian Style]]''
        (1966), says that he hated many of the songs chosen for his films.{{sfn|Lisanti|2000|pp=19, 136}} The
        Jordanaires' Gordon Stoker describes how Presley would retreat from the studio microphone: "The material was so
        bad that he felt like he couldn't sing it."{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=201}} Most of the film albums featured a song
        or two from respected writers such as the team of [[Doc Pomus]] and [[Mort Shuman]]. But by and large, according
        to biographer [[Jerry Hopkins (author)|Jerry Hopkins]], the numbers seemed to be "written on order by men who
        never really understood Elvis or rock and roll."{{sfn|Hopkins|2002|p=32}} Regardless of the songs' quality, it
        has been argued that Presley generally sang them well, with commitment.{{sfn|Matthew-Walker|1979|p=66}} Critic
        Dave Marsh heard the opposite: "Presley isn't trying, probably the wisest course in the face of material like
        'No Room to Rumba in a Sports Car' and '[[Rock-A-Hula Baby|Rock-a-Hula Baby]].'"{{sfn|Marsh|1980|p=395}}

        In the first half of the decade, three of Presley's soundtrack albums hit number one on the pop charts, and a
        few of his most popular songs came from his films, such as "[[Can't Help Falling in Love]]" (1961) and "[[Return
        to Sender (song)|Return to Sender]]" (1962). ("[[Viva Las Vegas (song)|Viva Las Vegas]]", the title track to the
        1964 film, was a minor hit as a B-side, and became truly popular only later.) But, as with artistic merit, the
        commercial returns steadily diminished. During a five-year span—1964 through 1968—Presley had only one top-ten
        hit: "[[Crying in the Chapel]]" (1965), a gospel number recorded back in 1960. As for non-film albums, between
        the June 1962 release of ''[[Pot Luck (Elvis Presley album)|Pot Luck]]'' and the November 1968 release of the
        soundtrack to the television special that signaled his comeback, only one LP of new material by Presley was
        issued: the gospel album ''[[How Great Thou Art (Elvis Presley album)|How Great Thou Art]]'' (1967). It won him
        his first [[Grammy Award]], for Best Sacred Performance. As Marsh described, Presley was "arguably the greatest
        white gospel singer of his time [and] really the last rock & roll artist to make gospel as vital a component of
        his musical personality as his secular songs."{{sfn|Marsh|2004|p=650}}

        Shortly before Christmas 1966, more than seven years since they first met, Presley proposed to Priscilla
        Beaulieu. They were married on May 1, 1967, in a brief ceremony in their suite at the Aladdin Hotel in Las
        Vegas.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=261–63}} The flow of formulaic films and assembly-line soundtracks rolled on. It
        was not until October 1967, when the ''[[Clambake]]'' soundtrack LP registered record low sales for a new
        Presley album, that RCA executives recognized a problem. "By then, of course, the damage had been done", as
        historians Connie Kirchberg and Marc Hendrickx put it. "Elvis was viewed as a joke by serious music lovers and a
        has-been to all but his most loyal fans."{{sfn|Kirchberg|Hendrickx|1999|p=73}}

        ===1968–73: Comeback===

        ====''Elvis'': the '68 Comeback Special====

        Presley's only child, [[Lisa Marie Presley|Lisa Marie]], was born on February 1, 1968, during a period when he
        had grown deeply unhappy with his career.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=171}} Of the eight Presley singles released
        between January 1967 and May 1968, only two charted in the top 40, and none higher than number
        28.{{sfn|Whitburn|2004|pp=502–03}} His forthcoming soundtrack album, ''[[Speedway (album)|Speedway]]'', would
        die at number 82 on the ''Billboard'' chart. Parker had already shifted his plans to television, where Presley
        had not appeared since the Sinatra Timex show in 1960. He maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network
        to both finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=4}}

        1968.{{sfn|Keogh|2004|p=263}}{{sfn|Rolling Stone|2009}}]]
        Recorded in late June in [[Burbank, California]], the special, called simply ''Elvis'', aired on December 3,
        1968. Later known as the '68 Comeback Special, the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as
        songs performed with a band in front of a small audience—Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live
        segments saw Presley clad in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent
        of his early rock-and-roll days. [[Bill Belew]], who designed this outfit, gave it a Napoleonic standing collar
        (Presley customarily wore high collars because he believed his neck looked too long), a design feature that he
        would later make a major trademark of the outfits Presley wore on stage in his later years. Director and
        coproducer [[Steve Binder]] had worked hard to reassure the nervous singer and to produce a show that was far
        from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=293, 296}} The show,
        NBC's highest rated that season, captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience.{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=26}}
        [[Jon Landau]] of ''Eye'' magazine remarked, "There is something magical about watching a man who has lost
        himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers.
        He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made [[Jim Morrison]] green with
        envy."{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=215}} Dave Marsh calls the performance one of "emotional grandeur and historical
        resonance."{{sfn|Marsh|2004|p=649}}

        By January 1969, the single "[[If I Can Dream]]", written for the special, reached number 12. The [[NBC-TV
        Special|soundtrack album]] broke into the top ten. According to friend [[Jerry Schilling]], the special reminded
        Presley of what "he had not been able to do for years, being able to choose the people; being able to choose
        what songs and not being told what had to be on the soundtrack.&nbsp;... He was out of prison,
        man."{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=26}} Binder said of Presley's reaction, "I played Elvis the 60-minute show, and he
        told me in the screening room, 'Steve, it's the greatest thing I've ever done in my life. I give you my word I
        will never sing a song I don't believe in.'"{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=26}}

        ====''From Elvis In Memphis'' and the International====
        {{Listen |filename=Power of My Love.ogg|title="Power of My Love" |description=Beginning with his American Sound
        recordings, [[soul music]] became a central element in Presley's fusion of styles. Here, he revels in lyrics
        full of sexual innuendo.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=277}}}}
        Buoyed by the experience of the Comeback Special, Presley engaged in a prolific series of recording sessions at
        [[American Sound Studio]], which led to the acclaimed ''[[From Elvis in Memphis]]''. Released in June 1969, it
        was his first secular, non-soundtrack album from a dedicated period in the studio in eight years. As described
        by Dave Marsh, it is "a masterpiece in which Presley immediately catches up with pop music trends that had
        seemed to pass him by during the movie years. He sings country songs, soul songs and rockers with real
        conviction, a stunning achievement."{{sfn|Marsh|1980|p=396}}

        Presley was keen to resume regular live performing. Following the success of the Comeback Special, offers came
        in from around the world. The [[London Palladium]] offered Parker $28,000 for a one-week engagement. He
        responded, "That's fine for me, now how much can you get for Elvis?"{{sfn|Gordon|2005|p=146}} In May, the brand
        new [[Las Vegas Hilton|International Hotel]] in Las Vegas, boasting the largest showroom in the city, announced
        that it had booked Presley, scheduling him to perform 57 shows over four weeks beginning July 31. Moore,
        Fontana, and the Jordanaires declined to participate, afraid of losing the lucrative session work they had in
        Nashville. Presley assembled new, top-notch accompaniment, led by guitarist [[James Burton]] and including two
        gospel groups, [[The Imperials]] and [[The Sweet Inspirations]].{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=283}} Nonetheless, he was
        nervous: his only previous Las Vegas engagement, in 1956, had been dismal, and he had neither forgotten nor
        forgiven that failure. To revise his approach to performances, Presley visited Las Vegas hotel showrooms and
        lounges, at one of which, that of the Flamingo, he encountered [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], whose
        aggressive style was similar to his own 1950s approach; the two became friends. Already studying [[karate]] at
        the time, Presley recruited Bill Belew to design variants of karatekas's ''gis'' for him; these, in jumpsuit
        form, would be his "stage uniforms" in his later years. Parker, who intended to make Presley's return the show
        business event of the year, oversaw a major promotional push. For his part, hotel owner [[Kirk Kerkorian]]
        arranged to send his own plane to New York to fly in rock journalists for the debut
        performance.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=346–47}}

        Presley took to the stage without introduction. The audience of 2200, including many celebrities, gave him a
        standing ovation before he sang a note and another after his performance. A third followed his encore, "Can't
        Help Falling in Love" (a song that would be his closing number for much of the
        1970s).{{sfn|Gordon|2005|pp=149–50}} At a press conference after the show, when a journalist referred to him as
        "The King", Presley gestured toward [[Fats Domino]], who was taking in the scene. "No," Presley said, "that's
        the real king of rock and roll."{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=39}} The next day, Parker's negotiations with the hotel
        resulted in a five-year contract for Presley to play each February and August, at an annual salary of $1
        million.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=259, 262}} ''Newsweek'' commented, "There are several unbelievable
        things about Elvis, but the most incredible is his staying power in a world where meteoric careers fade like
        shooting stars."{{sfn|Moyer|2002|p=73}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called Presley "supernatural, his own
        resurrection."{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=287}} In November, Presley's final non-concert film, ''[[Change of
        Habit]]'', opened. The double album ''[[From Memphis To Vegas/From Vegas To Memphis]]'' came out the same month;
        the first LP consisted of live performances from the International, the second of more cuts from the American
        Sound sessions. "Suspicious Minds" reached the top of the charts—Presley's first U.S. pop number one in over
        seven years, and his last.

        [[Cassandra Peterson]], later television's Elvira, met Presley during this period in Las Vegas, where she was
        working as a showgirl. She recalls of their encounter, "He was so anti-drug when I met him. I mentioned to him
        that I smoked marijuana, and he was just appalled. He said, 'Don't ever do that again.'"{{sfn|Stein|1997}}
        Presley was not only deeply opposed to recreational drugs, he also rarely drank. Several of his family members
        had been alcoholics, a fate he intended to avoid.{{sfn|Mason|2007|p=81}}

        ====Back on tour and meeting Nixon====
        Presley returned to the International early in 1970 for the first of the year's two month-long engagements,
        performing two shows a night. Recordings from these shows were issued on the album ''[[On Stage (Elvis Presley
        album)|On Stage]]''.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=94}} In late February, Presley performed six
        attendance-record–breaking shows at the [[Houston Astrodome]].{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=95}} In April, the
        single "[[The Wonder of You]]" was issued—a number one hit in the UK, it topped the U.S. [[Hot Adult
        Contemporary Tracks|adult contemporary]] chart, as well. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] filmed rehearsal and
        concert footage at the International during August for the documentary ''[[Elvis: That's the Way It Is]]''.
        Presley was by now performing in a jumpsuit, which would become a trademark of his live act. During this
        engagement, he was threatened with murder unless $50,000 was paid. Presley had been the target of many threats
        since the 1950s, often without his knowledge.{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=253}} The [[Federal Bureau of
        Investigation|FBI]] took the threat seriously and security was stepped up for the next two shows. Presley went
        onstage with a [[Derringer]] in his right boot and a .45 pistol in his waistband, but the concerts went off
        without incident.{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=254}}{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=96}}

        The album ''[[That's the Way It Is (Elvis Presley album)|That's the Way It Is]]'', produced to accompany the
        documentary and featuring both studio and live recordings, marked a stylistic shift. As music historian John
        Robertson notes, "The authority of Presley's singing helped disguise the fact that the album stepped decisively
        away from the American-roots inspiration of the Memphis sessions towards a more middle-of-the-road sound. With
        country put on the back burner, and soul and R&B left in Memphis, what was left was very classy, very clean
        white pop—perfect for the Las Vegas crowd, but a definite retrograde step for Elvis."{{sfn|Robertson|2004|p=70}}
        After the end of his International engagement on September 7, Presley embarked on a week-long concert tour,
        largely of the South, his first since 1958. Another week-long tour, of the West Coast, followed in
        November.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=99}}

        On December 21, 1970, Presley engineered a meeting with President [[Richard Nixon]] at the White House, where he
        expressed his patriotism and his contempt for the [[hippies]], the growing [[drug culture]], and the
        [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] in general.

        He asked Nixon for a [[Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs]] badge, to add to similar items he had begun
        collecting and to signify official sanction of his patriotic efforts. Nixon, who apparently found the encounter
        awkward, expressed a belief that Presley could send a positive message to young people and that it was therefore
        important he "retain his credibility". Presley told Nixon that [[the Beatles]], whose songs he regularly
        performed in concert during the era,{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=284, 286, 307–08, 313, 326, 338, 357–58}}
        exemplified what he saw as a trend of anti-Americanism and drug abuse in popular
        culture.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=419–22}} (Presley and his friends had had a four-hour get-together with the
        Beatles five years earlier.) On hearing reports of the meeting, [[Paul McCartney]] later said he "felt a bit
        betrayed" and commented: "The great joke was that we were taking [illegal] drugs, and look what happened to
        him", a reference to Presley's death, hastened by prescription drug abuse.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=192}}

        The [[United States Junior Chamber|U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce]] named Presley one of its annual [[Ten
        Outstanding Young Americans|Ten Most Outstanding Young Men of the Nation]] on January 16,
        1971.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=321}} Not long after, the City of Memphis named the stretch of [[U.S. Route
        51|Highway 51 South]] on which Graceland is located "Elvis Presley Boulevard". The same year, Presley became the
        first rock and roll singer to be awarded the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]]
        (then known as the Bing Crosby Award) by the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]], the Grammy
        Award organization.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=299–300}} Three new, non-film Presley studio albums were
        released in 1971, as many as had come out over the previous eight years. Best received by critics was ''[[Elvis
        Country]]'', a [[Concept album|concept record]] that focused on genre standards.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=319}} The
        biggest seller was ''[[Elvis Sings the Wonderful World of Christmas]]'', "the truest statement of all",
        according to Greil Marcus. "In the midst of ten painfully genteel Christmas songs, every one sung with appalling
        sincerity and humility, one could find Elvis tom-catting his way through six blazing minutes of '[[Merry

        According to Guralnick, "the one real highlight" of one of the 1971 sessions were the recording of "I Will Be
        True," "It's Still Here," and "I'll Take You Home Again, Kathleen," a trio of songs that Presley recorded in a
        rare solo set, sitting at the piano after everyone else had gone home: "Yearning, wistfulness, loneliness,
        need—all were communicated with a naked lack of adornment that Elvis was seeming to find increasingly difficult
        to display in the formal process of recording."{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=438}}

        ====Marriage breakdown and ''Aloha from Hawaii''====
        {{See also|Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite}}
        MGM again filmed Presley in April 1972, this time for ''[[Elvis on Tour]]'', which went on to win the [[Golden
        Globe Award for Best Documentary Film]] that year. His gospel album ''[[He Touched Me (album)|He Touched Me]]'',
        released that month, would earn him his second Grammy Award, for Best Inspirational Performance. A 14-date tour
        commenced with an unprecedented four consecutive sold-out shows at New York's [[Madison Square
        Garden]].{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=308}} The evening concert on July 10 was recorded and issued in LP
        form a week later. ''[[Elvis: As Recorded at Madison Square Garden]]'' became one of Presley's biggest-selling
        albums. After the tour, the single "[[Burning Love]]" was released—Presley's last top ten hit on the U.S. pop
        chart. "The most exciting single Elvis has made since 'All Shook Up'", wrote rock critic [[Robert Christgau]].
        "Who else could make 'It's coming closer, the flames are now licking my body' sound like an assignation with
        [[James Brown]]'s [[The Famous Flames|backup band]]?"{{sfn|Marcus|1982|p=283}}

        outfit's eagle motif, as "something that would say 'America' to the world."{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=478}}]]

        Presley and his wife, meanwhile, had become increasingly distant, barely cohabiting. In 1971, an affair he had
        with Joyce Bova resulted—unbeknownst to him—in her pregnancy and an abortion.{{sfn|Williamson|2015|pp=253–254}}
        He often raised the possibility of her moving into Graceland, saying that he was likely to leave
        Priscilla.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=451, 446, 453}} The Presleys separated on February 23, 1972, after Priscilla
        disclosed her relationship with [[Mike Stone (karate)|Mike Stone]], a karate instructor Presley had recommended
        to her. Priscilla relates that when she told him, Presley "grabbed&nbsp;... and forcefully made love to" her,
        declaring, "This is how a real man makes love to his woman."{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=456}} Five months later,
        Presley's new girlfriend, [[Linda Thompson (actress)|Linda Thompson]], a songwriter and one-time Memphis beauty
        queen, moved in with him.{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=291}} Presley and his wife filed for divorce on August

        "was a blow from which he never recovered."{{sfn|Moscheo|2007|p=132}}

        In January 1973, Presley performed two benefit concerts for the [[Kui Lee|Kui Lee Cancer Fund]] in connection
        with a groundbreaking TV special, ''[[Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite|Aloha from Hawaii]]''. The first show
        served as a practice run and backup should technical problems affect the live broadcast two days later. Aired as
        scheduled on January 14, ''Aloha from Hawaii'' was the first global concert satellite broadcast, reaching
        millions of viewers live and on tape
        delay.{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=10}}{{sfn|Brown|Broeske|1997|p=364}}{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=475}} Presley's costume
        became the most recognized example of the elaborate concert garb with which his latter-day persona became
        closely associated. As described by [[Bobbie Ann Mason]], "At the end of the show, when he spreads out his
        American Eagle cape, with the full stretched wings of the eagle studded on the back, he becomes a god
        figure."{{sfn|Mason|2007|p=141}} The [[Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite (album)|accompanying double album]],
        released in February, went to number one and eventually sold over 5 million copies in the United

        At a midnight show the same month, four men rushed onto the stage in an apparent attack. Security men leapt to
        Presley's defense, and the singer's karate instinct took over as he ejected one invader from the stage himself.
        Following the show, he became obsessed with the idea that the men had been sent by Mike Stone to kill him.
        Though they were shown to have been only overexuberant fans, he raged, "There's too much pain in me&nbsp;...
        Stone [must] die." His outbursts continued with such intensity that a physician was unable to calm him, despite
        administering large doses of medication. After another two full days of raging, [[Red West]], his friend and
        bodyguard, felt compelled to get a price for a contract killing and was relieved when Presley decided, "Aw hell,
        let's just leave it for now. Maybe it's a bit heavy."{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=488–90}}

        ===1973–77: Health deterioration and death===

        ====Medical crises and last studio sessions====
        Presley's divorce took effect on October 9, 1973.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=329}} He was now becoming
        increasingly unwell. Twice during the year he overdosed on [[barbiturate]]s, spending three days in a coma in
        his hotel suite after the first incident. Toward the end of 1973, he was hospitalized, semicomatose from the
        effects of [[Demerol]] addiction. According to his main physician, Dr. [[George C. Nichopoulos]], Presley "felt
        that by getting [drugs] from a doctor, he wasn't the common everyday junkie getting something off the
        street."{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}} Since his comeback, he had staged more live shows with each passing year, and
        1973 saw 168 concerts, his busiest schedule ever.{{sfn|Keogh|2004|p=238}} Despite his failing health, in 1974 he
        undertook another intensive touring schedule.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=481, 487, 499, 504, 519–20}}

        Presley's condition declined precipitously in September. Keyboardist [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]]
        remembers the singer's arrival at a [[University of Maryland]] concert: "He fell out of the limousine, to his
        knees. People jumped to help, and he pushed them away like, 'Don't help me.' He walked on stage and held onto
        the mike for the first thirty minutes like it was a post. Everybody's looking at each other like, Is the tour
        gonna happen?"{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=547}} Guitarist John Wilkinson recalled, "He was all gut. He was slurring.
        He was so fucked up.&nbsp;... It was obvious he was drugged. It was obvious there was something terribly wrong
        with his body. It was so bad the words to the songs were barely intelligible.&nbsp;... I remember crying. He
        could barely get through the introductions".{{sfn|Hopkins|1986|p=136}} Wilkinson recounted that a few nights
        later in [[Detroit, Michigan]], "I watched him in his dressing room, just draped over a chair, unable to move.
        So often I thought, 'Boss, why don't you just cancel this tour and take a year off&nbsp;...?' I mentioned
        something once in a guarded moment. He patted me on the back and said, 'It'll be all right. Don't you worry
        about it.'"{{sfn|Hopkins|1986|p=136}} Presley continued to play to sellout crowds.

        On July 13, 1976, Vernon Presley—who had become deeply involved in his son's financial affairs—fired "[[Memphis
        Mafia]]" bodyguards Red West (Presley's friend since the 1950s), Sonny West, and David Hebler, citing the need
        to "cut back on expenses".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=50,
        148}}{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=601–04}}{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=139}} Presley was in [[Palm Springs,

        and some suggest the singer was too cowardly to face the three himself. Another associate of Presley's, John
        O'Grady, argued that the bodyguards were dropped because their rough treatment of fans had prompted too many
        lawsuits.{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=354}} However, Presley's stepbrother David Stanley has claimed that the bodyguards
        were fired because they were becoming more outspoken about Presley's drug
        dependency.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=140}}

        RCA, which had enjoyed a steady stream of product from Presley for over a decade, grew anxious as his interest
        in spending time in the studio waned. After a December 1973 session that produced 18 songs, enough for almost
        two albums, he did not enter the studio in 1974.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=560}} Parker sold RCA on another concert
        record, ''[[Elvis Recorded Live on Stage in Memphis]]''.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=336}} Recorded on March
        20, it included a version of "How Great Thou Art" that would win Presley his third and final competitive Grammy
        Award.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=381}} (All three of his competitive Grammy wins—out of 14 total nominations—were
        for gospel recordings.) Presley returned to the studio in Hollywood in March 1975, but Parker's attempts to
        arrange another session toward the end of the year were unsuccessful.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=584–85}} In 1976,
        RCA sent a mobile studio to Graceland that made possible two full-scale recording sessions at Presley's
        home.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=593–95}} Even in that comfortable context, the recording process was now a struggle
        for him.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=595}}

        {{Listen |filename=Hurt (Presley).ogg|title="Hurt" |description=An R&B hit for [[Roy Hamilton]] in 1955 and a

        picked up by country radio in 1976.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=397}}}}
        For all the concerns of his label and manager, in studio sessions between July 1973 and October 1976, Presley
        recorded virtually the entire contents of six albums. Though he was no longer a major presence on the pop
        charts, five of those albums entered the top five of the country chart, and three went to number one:
        ''[[Promised Land (Elvis Presley album)|Promised Land]]'' (1975), ''[[From Elvis Presley Boulevard, Memphis,
        Tennessee]]'' (1976), and ''[[Moody Blue]]'' (1977).{{sfn|Caulfield|2004|p=24}} The story was similar with his
        singles—there were no major pop hits, but Presley was a significant force in not just the country market, but on
        adult contemporary radio as well. Eight studio singles from this period released during his lifetime were top
        ten hits on one or both charts, four in 1974 alone. "[[My Boy]]" was a number one adult contemporary hit in
        1975, and "[[Moody Blue (Elvis song)|Moody Blue]]" topped the country chart and reached the second spot on the
        adult contemporary chart in 1976.{{sfn|Whitburn|2006|p=273}} Perhaps his most critically acclaimed recording of
        the era came that year, with what Greil Marcus described as his "apocalyptic attack" on the soul classic
        "Hurt".{{sfn|Marcus|1982|p=284}} "If he felt the way he sounded", Dave Marsh wrote of Presley's performance,
        "the wonder isn't that he had only a year left to live but that he managed to survive that
        long."{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=430}}

        ====Final year and death====
        Presley and Linda Thompson split in November 1976, and he took up with a new girlfriend, Ginger
        Alden.{{sfn|Victor|2008|pp=8, 526}} He proposed to Alden and gave her an engagement ring two months later,
        though several of his friends later claimed that he had no serious intention of marrying
        again.{{sfn|Victor|2008|pp=8, 224, 325}} Journalist Tony Scherman writes that by early 1977, "Presley had become
        a grotesque caricature of his sleek, energetic former self. Hugely overweight, his mind dulled by the
        pharmacopoeia he daily ingested, he was barely able to pull himself through his abbreviated
        concerts."{{sfn|Scherman|2006}} In [[Alexandria, Louisiana]], the singer was on stage for less than an hour and
        "was impossible to understand".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=628}} Presley failed to appear in [[Baton Rouge]]; he was
        unable to get out of his hotel bed, and the rest of the tour was cancelled.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=628}} Despite
        the accelerating deterioration of his health, he stuck to most touring commitments. In [[Rapid City, South
        Dakota]], "he was so nervous on stage that he could hardly talk", according to Presley historian Samuel Roy, and
        unable to "perform any significant movement."{{sfn|Roy|1985|p=71}} Guralnick relates that fans "were becoming
        increasingly voluble about their disappointment, but it all seemed to go right past Elvis, whose world was now
        confined almost entirely to his room and his [[spiritualism]] books."{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=634}} A cousin,
        Billy Smith, recalled how Presley would sit in his room and chat for hours, sometimes recounting favorite
        [[Monty Python]] sketches and his own past escapades, but more often gripped by paranoid obsessions that
        reminded Smith of [[Howard Hughes]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=212, 642}} "[[Way Down]]", Presley's last single
        issued during his lifetime, came out on June 6. On the next tour, CBS filmed two concerts for a TV Special,
        ''Elvis in Concert'', to be aired in October. On the first of these, captured in Omaha on June 19, Presley's
        voice, Guralnick writes, "is almost unrecognizable, a small, childlike instrument in which he talks more than
        sings most of the songs, casts about uncertainly for the melody in others, and is virtually unable to articulate
        or project."{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=638-39}} He did better on the second night, two days later in Rapid City,
        Iowa: "He looked healthier, seemed to have lost a little weight, and sounded better, too", though his appearance
        was still a "face framed in a helmet of blue-black hair from which sweat sheets down over pale, swollen
        cheeks."{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=638}} His final concert was held in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] at [[Market Square
        Arena]], on June 26.

        [[File:Elvis grave Graceland.jpg|thumb|alt=A long, ground-level gravestone reads "Elvis Aaron Presley", followed

        The book ''[[Elvis: What Happened?]]'', cowritten by the three bodyguards fired the previous year, was published
        on August 1.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=148}} It was the first exposé to detail Presley's years of drug misuse.

        Presley was scheduled to fly out of Memphis on the evening of August 16, 1977, to begin another tour. That
        afternoon, Ginger Alden discovered him unresponsive on his bathroom floor. Attempts to revive him failed, and
        death was officially pronounced at 3:30&nbsp;pm at Baptist Memorial Hospital.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=645–48}}

        President [[Jimmy Carter]] issued a statement that credited Presley with having "permanently changed the face of
        American popular culture".{{sfn|Woolley|Peters|1977}} Thousands of people gathered outside Graceland to view the
        open casket. One of Presley's cousins, Billy Mann, accepted $18,000 to secretly photograph the corpse; the
        picture appeared on the cover of the ''[[National Enquirer]]''{{'}}s biggest-selling issue
        ever.{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=386}} Alden struck a $105,000 deal with the ''Enquirer'' for her story, but settled

        will.{{sfn|Victor|2008|pp=581–82}}

        Presley's funeral was held at Graceland, on Thursday, August 18. Outside the gates, a car plowed into a group of
        fans, killing two women and critically injuring a third.{{sfn|Matthew-Walker|1979|p=26}} Approximately 80,000
        people lined the processional route to Forest Hill Cemetery, where Presley was buried next to his
        mother.{{sfn|Pendergast|Pendergast|2000|p=108}} Within a few days, "Way Down" topped the country and UK pop
        charts.{{sfn|Whitburn|2006|p=273}}{{sfn|Warwick et al.|2004|pp=860–66}}

        Following an attempt to steal the singer's body in late August, the remains of both Presley and his mother were
        reburied in Graceland's Meditation Garden on October&nbsp;2.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=660}}

        Since his death, there have been numerous alleged sightings of Presley. A long-standing theory among some fans
        is that he faked his death.{{sfn|Coady|2003|pp=197–209}}{{sfn|Harrison|1992|pp=42, 157–160, 169}} Fans have
        noted alleged discrepancies in the death certificate, reports of a wax dummy in his original coffin and numerous
        accounts of Presley planning a diversion so he could retire in peace.{{sfn|Harrison|1992|pp=159–160}}

        ===Questions over cause of death===
        "Drug use was heavily implicated" in Presley's death, writes Guralnick. "No one ruled out the possibility of
        anaphylactic shock brought on by the codeine pills&nbsp;... to which he was known to have had a mild allergy." A
        pair of lab reports filed two months later each strongly suggested that [[polypharmacy]] was the primary cause
        of death; one reported "fourteen drugs in Elvis' system, ten in significant
        quantity."{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=652}} Forensic historian and pathologist Michael Baden views the situation as
        complicated: "Elvis had had an enlarged heart for a long time. That, together with his drug habit, caused his
        death. But he was difficult to diagnose; it was a judgment call."{{sfn|Baden|Hennessee|1990|p=35}}

        The competence and ethics of two of the centrally involved medical professionals were seriously questioned.
        Before the autopsy was complete and toxicology results known, [[Coroner|medical examiner]] Dr. Jerry Francisco
        declared the cause of death as [[cardiac arrhythmia]], a condition that can be determined only in someone who is
        still alive.{{sfn|Ramsland|2010}} Allegations of a cover-up were widespread.{{sfn|Baden|Hennessee|1990|p=35}}
        While Presley's main physician, Dr. Nichopoulos, was exonerated of criminal liability for the singer's death,
        the facts were startling: "In the first eight months of 1977 alone, he had [prescribed] more than 10,000 doses
        of sedatives, amphetamines and narcotics: all in Elvis's name." His license was suspended for three months. It
        was permanently revoked in the 1990s after the Tennessee Medical Board brought new charges of
        over-prescription.{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}}

        Amidst mounting pressure in 1994, the Presley autopsy was reopened. Coroner Dr. Joseph Davis declared, "There is
        nothing in any of the data that supports a death from drugs. In fact, everything points to a sudden, violent
        heart attack."{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}} Whether or not [[combined drug intoxication]] was in fact the cause,
        there is little doubt that polypharmacy contributed significantly to Presley's premature
        death.{{sfn|Ramsland|2010}}

        ===Since 1977===
        Between 1977 and 1981, six posthumously released singles by Presley were top ten country
        hits.{{sfn|Whitburn|2006|p=273}} Graceland was opened to the public in 1982. Attracting over half a million
        visitors annually, it is the second most-visited home in the United States, after the White
        House.{{sfn|Brown|Broeske|1997|p=433}} It was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 2006.{{sfn|National

        1984, he received the [[Blues Music Award|W. C. Handy Award]] from the [[Blues Foundation]] and the [[Academy of
        Country Music]]'s first Golden Hat Award. In 1987, he received the [[American Music Award]]s' Award of
        Merit.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=33}}

        A [[Junkie XL]] remix of Presley's "[[A Little Less Conversation]]" (credited as "Elvis Vs JXL") was used in a
        [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] advertising campaign during the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]. It topped the charts in over 20
        countries, and was included in a compilation of Presley's number one hits, ''[[ELV1S]]'', that was also an
        international success. In 2003, a remix of "[[Rubberneckin']]", a 1969 recording of Presley's, topped the U.S.
        sales chart, as did a 50th-anniversary re-release of "That's All Right" the following
        year.{{sfn|Bronson|2004|p=1}} The latter was an outright hit in the UK, reaching number three on the pop chart.

        In 2005, another three reissued singles, "Jailhouse Rock", "One Night"/"I Got Stung", and "It's Now or Never",
        went to number one in the United Kingdom. A total of 17 Presley singles were reissued during the year; all made
        the British top five. For the fifth straight year, ''[[Forbes]]'' named Presley the top-earning deceased
        celebrity, with a gross income of $45 million.{{sfn|Goldman|Ewalt|2007}} He placed second in
        2006,{{sfn|Rose|2006}} returned to the top spot the next two years,{{sfn|Goldman|Paine|2007}}{{sfn|Hoy|2008}}
        and ranked fourth in 2009.{{sfn|Pomerantz et al.|2009}} The following year, he was ranked second, with his
        highest annual income ever—$60 million—spurred by the celebration of his 75th birthday and the launch of
        [[Cirque du Soleil]]'s ''[[Viva Elvis]]'' show in Las Vegas.{{sfn|Rose et al.|2010}} In November 2010, ''[[Viva
        Elvis (album)|Viva Elvis: The Album]]'' was released, setting his voice to newly recorded instrumental
        tracks.{{sfn|Baillie|2010}}{{sfn|Bouchard|2010}} As of mid-2011, there were an estimated 15,000 licensed Presley
        products.{{sfn|Lynch|2011}} He was again the second-highest-earning deceased celebrity.{{sfn|Pomerantz|2011}}

        Presley holds the records for most songs charting in ''Billboard''{{'}}s top 40 and top 100: chart statistician
        [[Joel Whitburn]] calculates the respective totals as 104 and 151;{{sfn|Hilburn|2007}} Presley historian Adam
        Victor gives 114 and 138.{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=438}} Presley's rankings for top-ten and number-one hits vary
        depending on how the double-sided "Hound Dog/Don't Be Cruel" and "Don't/I Beg of You" singles, which precede the
        inception of ''Billboard''{{'}}s unified [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart, are analyzed.{{refn|Whitburn
        follows actual ''Billboard'' history in considering the four songs on the "Don't Be Cruel/Hound Dog" and
        "Don't/I Beg of You" singles as distinct. He tallies each side of the former single as a number one
        (''Billboard''{{'}}s sales chart had "Don't Be Cruel" at number one for five weeks, then "Hound Dog" for six)
        and reckons "I Beg of You" as a top ten, as it reached number eight on the old Top 100 chart. ''Billboard'' now
        considers both singles as unified items, ignoring the historical sales split of the former and its old Top 100
        chart entirely. Whitburn thus analyzes the four songs as yielding three number ones and a total of four top
        tens. ''Billboard'' now states that they yielded just two number ones and a total of two top tens, voiding the
        separate chart appearances of "Hound Dog" and "I Beg of You".|name=billboard|group=lower-alpha}} According to

        ==Artistry==

        ===Influences===
        Presley's earliest musical influence came from [[gospel music|gospel]]. His mother recalled that from the age of
        two, at the Assembly of God church in Tupelo attended by the family, "he would slide down off my lap, run into
        the aisle and scramble up to the platform. There he would stand looking at the choir and trying to sing with
        them."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=14}} In Memphis, Presley frequently attended all-night gospel singings at the Ellis
        Auditorium, where groups such as the [[The Statesmen Quartet|Statesmen Quartet]] led the music in a style that,
        Guralnick suggests, sowed the seeds of Presley's future stage act:
        {{blockquote|The Statesmen were an electric combination&nbsp;... featuring some of the most thrillingly emotive
        singing and daringly unconventional showmanship in the entertainment world&nbsp;... dressed in suits that might
        have come out of the window of Lansky's.&nbsp;... Bass singer Jim Wetherington, known universally as the Big
        Chief, maintained a steady bottom, ceaselessly jiggling first his left leg, then his right, with the material of
        the pants leg ballooning out and shimmering. "He went about as far as you could go in gospel music," said Jake
        Hess. "The women would jump up, just like they do for the pop shows." Preachers frequently objected to the lewd
        movements&nbsp;... but audiences reacted with screams and swoons.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=47–48}}}}
        As a teenager, Presley's musical interests were wide-ranging, and he was deeply informed about African American
        musical idioms as well as white ones (see "[[#Teenage life in Memphis|Teenage life in Memphis]]"). Though he
        never had any formal training, he was blessed with a remarkable memory, and his musical knowledge was already
        considerable by the time he made his first professional recordings in 1954 at the age of 19. When Jerry Leiber
        and Mike Stoller met him two years later, they were astonished at his encyclopedic understanding of the
        blues.{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=211}} At a press conference the following year, he proudly declared, "I know
        practically every religious song that's ever been written."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=430}}

        ===Musical style and genres===
        Presley was a central figure in the development of [[rockabilly]], according to music historians. Katherine
        Charlton even calls him "rockabilly's originator",{{sfn|Charlton|2006|p=103}} though [[Carl Perkins]] has
        explicitly stated that "[Sam] Phillips, Elvis, and I didn't create rockabilly."
        <ref>Cited in Wayne Jancik, ''The Billboard Book of One-Hit Wonders'' (1998), p.16.</ref>
        and, according to Michael Campbell, "[[Bill Haley]] recorded the first big rockabilly hit."
        <ref>Michael Campbell, ''Popular Music in America'' (3rd edition, 2009), p.161.</ref>
        "It had been there for quite a while", says Scotty Moore. "Carl Perkins was doing basically the same sort of
        thing up around Jackson, and I know for a fact Jerry Lee Lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he
        was ten years old."
        <ref>Cited in Peter Guralnick, ''Lost Highway: Journeys & Arrivals of American Musicians'' (1989), p.104.</ref>
        However, "Rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with Elvis Presley's first release, on the
        Sun label", writes Craig Morrison.{{sfn|Morrison|1996|p=x}} Paul Friedlander describes the defining elements of
        rockabilly, which he similarly characterizes as "essentially&nbsp;... an Elvis Presley construction": "the raw,
        emotive, and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling [of] the blues with the string band and
        strummed rhythm guitar [of] country".{{sfn|Friedlander|1996|p=45}} In "That's All Right", the Presley trio's
        first record, Scotty Moore's guitar solo, "a combination of [[Merle Travis]]–style country finger-picking,
        double-stop slides from acoustic boogie, and blues-based bent-note, single-string work, is a microcosm of this
        fusion."{{sfn|Friedlander|1996|p=45}}

        At RCA, Presley's rock and roll sound grew distinct from rockabilly with group chorus vocals, more heavily
        amplified electric guitars{{sfn|Gillett|2000|p=113}} and a tougher, more intense
        manner.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=39}} While he was known for taking songs from various sources and giving them a
        rockabilly/rock and roll treatment, he also recorded songs in other genres from early in his career, from the
        pop standard "[[Blue Moon (1934 song)|Blue Moon]]" at Sun to the country ballad "How's the World Treating You?"
        on his second LP to the blues of "Santa Claus Is Back In Town". In 1957, his first gospel record was released,
        the four-song EP ''Peace in the Valley''. Certified as a million seller, it became the top-selling gospel EP in
        recording history.{{sfn|Wolfe|1994|p=14}} Presley would record gospel periodically for the rest of his life.
        {{Listen |filename=Run On.ogg|title="Run On" |description=From ''[[How Great Thou Art (Elvis Presley album)|How
        Great Thou Art]]'' (1967), a traditional song popular in the black gospel tradition. The arrangement evokes "the
        percussive style of the 1930s [[Golden Gate Quartet]]."{{sfn|Wolfe|1994|p=22}}{{sfn|Keogh|2004|p=184}}}}
        After his return from military service in 1960, Presley continued to perform rock and roll, but the
        characteristic style was substantially toned down. The reason why the music from this period lacks the drama
        from his Fifties recordings, critic Dave Marsh writes, is "because what we're hearing is not genius discovering
        itself but the sound of genius at work."{{sfn|Marsh|1982|p=145}} His first post-Army single, the number one hit
        "[[Stuck on You (Elvis Presley song)|Stuck on You]]", is typical of this shift. RCA publicity materials referred
        to its "mild rock beat"; discographer Ernst Jorgensen calls it "upbeat pop".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=123}} The
        modern blues/R&B sound captured so successfully on ''Elvis Is Back!'' was essentially abandoned for six years
        until such 1966–67 recordings as "Down in the Alley" and "[[Hi-Heel Sneakers]]",{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=213,
        237}} though Marsh holds that while he may have recorded few blues songs in the early to middle Sixties, "blues
        informs almost everything here."{{sfn|Marsh|1982|p=145}} The singer's output during most of the 1960s emphasized
        pop music, often in the form of ballads such as "[[Are You Lonesome Tonight? (song)|Are You Lonesome
        Tonight?]]", a number one in 1960. While that was a dramatic number, most of what Presley recorded for his film
        soundtracks was in a much lighter vein.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=142–43}} Notable numbers in other genres are the
        No. 1 hits "[[It's Now or Never (song)|It's Now or Never]]" of 1960, based on the Italian aria "O Sole Mio" and
        concluding with a "full-voiced operatic cadence," {{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=65}} and the 1962 hit "[[She's Not
        You]]" which "integrates the Jordanaires so completely, it's practically doo-wop."{{sfn|Marsh|1982|p=145}}

        While Presley performed several of his classic ballads for the '68 Comeback Special, the sound of the show was
        dominated by aggressive rock and roll. He would record few new straight-ahead rock and roll songs thereafter; as
        he explained, they were "hard to find".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=343}} A significant exception was "Burning Love",
        his last major hit on the pop charts. Like his work of the 1950s, Presley's subsequent recordings reworked pop
        and country songs, but in markedly different permutations. His stylistic range now began to embrace a more
        contemporary rock sound as well as soul and [[funk]]. Much of ''Elvis In Memphis'', as well as "Suspicious
        Minds", cut at the same sessions, reflected his new rock and soul fusion. In the mid-1970s, many of his singles
        found a home on country radio, the field where he first became a star.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=199}}

        ===Vocal style and range===
        The general development of Presley's voice is described by critic Dave Marsh as "A voice, high and thrilled in
        the early days, lower and perplexed in the final months."{{sfn|Marsh|1982|p=234}} Marsh credits Presley with the
        introduction of the "vocal stutter" on 1955's "Baby Let's Play House."{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=317}} When on "Don't Be
        Cruel" Presley "slides into a 'mmmmm' that marks the transition between the first two verses," he shows "how
        masterful his relaxed style really is."{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=91}} Marsh describes the singing on "Can't Help
        Falling in Love" to be of "gentle insistence and delicacy of phrasing," with the line "'Shall I stay'"
        pronounced as if the words are fragile as crystal."{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=490}} On the operatic "It's Now or Never"
        Presley "was reaching for something more than he had ever attempted before,"{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=65}} and,
        according to discographer Jorgensen, later the same year the melody to "Surrender", a number also based on an
        Italian original, "Torna A Sorrento", "required an even greater demonstration of vocal
        powers."{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=140}}

        Jorgensen calls the 1966 recording of "How Great Thou Art" "an extraordinary fulfillment of his vocal
        ambitions," as Presley had "crafted for himself an ad-hoc arrangement in which he took every part of the
        four-part vocal, from [the] bass intro to the soaring heights of the song's operatic climax," in the process
        becoming "a kind of one-man quartet."{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=212}} Guralnick finds "Stand By Me" from the same
        sessions "a beautifully articulated, almost nakedly yearning performance," but, by contrast, feels that Presley
        reaches beyond his powers on "Where No One Stands Alone" on which "he was reduced to a kind of inelegant
        bellowing to push out a sound" that Jake Hess would have no problem with. Hess himself thought that while others
        may have a voice as great or greater than Presley's, "he had that certain something that everyone searches for
        all during their lifetime."{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=232}} Guralnick attempts to pinpoint that something: "The
        warmth of his voice, his controlled use of both vibrato technique and natural falsetto range, the subtlety and
        deeply felt conviction of his singing were all qualities recognizably belonging to his talent but just as
        recognizably not to be achieved without sustained dedication and effort."{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=231}}

        Presley's singing to his own "necessarily limited, both rhythmically and melodically," piano accompaniment, such
        as can be heard on the 1967 recording of "You'll Never Walk Alone", for Guralnick are always special occasions,
        because "it was always a measure of his engagement when he sat down at the keyboard to
        play."{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=279}} Describing his piano technique as "staccato
        style,"{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=238}} Jorgensen finds that on "Without Love" from the 1969 sessions, "his
        gospel-flavored treatment took it to a level of spirituality rarely matched in his
        career."{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=273}} Presley also played the instrument on the "impassioned version" of the
        sessions's next song, "I'll Hold You in My Heart," of which Guralnick writes that "there is something magical
        about the moment that only the most inspired singing can bring about, as Elvis loses himself in the music, words
        no longer lend themselves to literal translation, and singer and listener both are left emotionally wrung out by
        the time the song finally limps to an end."{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=335}}

        Marsh praises his 1968 reading of "U.S. Male", "bearing down on the hard guy lyrics, not sending them up or
        overplaying them but tossing them around with that astonishingly tough yet gentle assurance that he brought to
        his Sun records."{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=424}} The performance on "In the Ghetto" is, according to Jorgensen, "devoid
        of any of his characteristic vocal tricks or mannerisms," instead relying on "the astonishing clarity and
        sensitivity of his voice."{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=271}} Guralnick describes the tenderness in the singing of the
        same song of "such unassuming, almost translucent eloquence, it is so quietly confident in its simplicity" that
        one is reminded of the Sun period, "offering equal parts yearning and social
        compassion."{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=332}} On "Suspicious Minds" from the same sessions Guralnick hears
        essentially the same "remarkable mixture of tenderness and poise," but supplemented with "an expressive quality
        somewhere between stoicism (at suspected infidelity) and anguish (over impending
        loss)."{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=335}}

        Music critic [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]] observes that "Presley has been described
        variously as a [[baritone]] and a [[tenor]]. An extraordinary compass&nbsp;... and a very wide range of vocal
        color have something to do with this divergence of opinion."{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} He identifies Presley
        as a high baritone, calculating his range as two [[octave]]s and a third, "from the baritone low [[G (musical
        note)|G]] to the tenor high [[B (musical note)|B]], with an upward extension in [[falsetto]] to at least a
        D-flat. Presley's best octave is in the middle, D-flat to D-flat, granting an extra full step up or
        down."{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} In Pleasants' view, his voice was "variable and unpredictable" at the bottom,
        "often brilliant" at the top, with the capacity for "full-voiced high Gs and [[A (musical note)|A]]s that an
        opera baritone might envy".{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} Scholar Lindsay Waters, who figures Presley's range as
        2¼ octaves, emphasizes that "his voice had an emotional range from tender whispers to sighs down to shouts,
        grunts, grumbles and sheer gruffness that could move the listener from calmness and surrender, to
        fear."{{sfn|Waters|2003|p=205}} Presley was always "able to duplicate the open, hoarse, ecstatic, screaming,
        shouting, wailing, reckless sound of the black rhythm-and-blues and gospel singers," writes Pleasants, and also
        demonstrated a remarkable ability to assimilate many other vocal styles.{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}}

        ==Public image==
        ===Racial issues===
        When Dewey Phillips first aired "That's All Right" on Memphis radio, many listeners who contacted the station by
        phone and telegram to ask for it again assumed that its singer was black.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=100–01}} From
        the beginning of his national fame, Presley expressed respect for African American performers and their music,
        and disregard for the norms of segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South. Interviewed in
        1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician [[Arthur Crudup]]—the originator of
        "That's All Right"—"bang his box the way I do now, and I said if I ever got to the place where I could feel all
        old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw."{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} ''The Memphis World'', an
        African American newspaper, reported that Presley, "the rock 'n' roll phenomenon", "cracked Memphis's
        segregation laws" by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its "colored
        night".{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} Such statements and actions led Presley to be generally hailed in the black
        community during the early days of his stardom.{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} By contrast, many white adults, according
        to ''Billboard''{{'}}s Arnold Shaw, "did not like him, and condemned him as depraved. Anti-negro prejudice
        doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of
        the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of
        sex."{{sfn|Denisoff|1975|p=22}}

        Despite the largely positive view of Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 that he had
        at some point announced, "The only thing Negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes." A
        journalist with the national African American weekly ''[[Jet magazine|Jet]]'', Louie Robinson, pursued the
        story. On the set of ''[[Jailhouse Rock (1957 film)|Jailhouse Rock]]'', Presley granted Robinson an interview,
        though he was no longer dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement or holding in any
        way to its racist view: "I never said anything like that, and people who know me know that I wouldn't have said
        it … A lot of people seem to think I started this business. But rock 'n' roll was here a long time before I came
        along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Let's face it: I can't sing like [[Fats Domino]]
        can. I know that."

        Also, Red Robinson stated, "Take a look at the things that are only publicized now, of how he'd be driving down
        the street and see a destitute black woman with a little child. He went and bought her a Cadillac. Now if this
        guy hated blacks, he wouldn’t even have gone near them".

        Robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, and on the contrary elicited testimony from many
        individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist.{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}}{{sfn|Pilgrim|2006}} Blues
        singer [[Ivory Joe Hunter]], who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland one evening, reported of
        Presley, "He showed me every courtesy, and I think he's one of the greatest."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=426}}
        [[Dudley Brooks]], an African-American composer and studio musician who worked with Presley during the 1950s and
        1960s, also disputed allegations that Presley was a racist.{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=220}} Though the rumored remark
        was wholly discredited at the time, it was still being used against Presley decades later.{{sfn|Kolawole|2002}}
        The identification of Presley with racism—either personally or symbolically—was expressed most famously in the
        lyrics of the 1989 rap hit "[[Fight the Power]]", by [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]: "Elvis was a hero to
        most / But he never meant shit to me / Straight-up racist that sucker was / Simple and
        plain".{{sfn|Myrie|2009|pp=123–24}}

        The persistence of such attitudes was fueled by resentment over the fact that Presley, whose musical and visual
        performance idiom owed much to African American sources, achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial
        success largely denied his black peers.{{sfn|Pilgrim|2006}} Into the 21st century, the notion that Presley had
        "stolen" black music still found adherents.{{sfn|Kolawole|2002}}{{sfn|Myrie|2009|pp=123–24}} Notable among
        African American entertainers expressly rejecting this view was [[Jackie Wilson]], who argued, "A lot of people
        have accused Elvis of stealing the black man's music, when in fact, almost every black solo entertainer copied
        his stage mannerisms from Elvis."{{sfn|Masley|2002}} And throughout his career, Presley plainly acknowledged his
        debt. Addressing his '68 Comeback Special audience, he said, "Rock 'n' roll music is basically gospel or rhythm
        and blues, or it sprang from that. People have been adding to it, adding instruments to it, experimenting with
        it, but it all boils down to [that]." Nine years earlier, he had said, "Rock 'n' roll has been around for many
        years. It used to be called rhythm and blues."{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=198}}

        ===Sex symbol===
        [[File:Girls Girls Girls Poster B.jpg|thumb|alt=Film poster with Presley on the left, holding a young woman
        around the waist, her arms draped over his shoulders. To the right, five young women wearing bathing suits and
        holding guitars stand in a row. The one in front taps Presley on the shoulder. Along with title and credits is
        the tagline "Climb aboard your dreamboat for the fastest-movin' fun 'n' music!"|The title and marketing of
        ''[[Girls! Girls! Girls!]]'' (1962) took advantage of Presley's sex symbol status.]]
        Presley's physical attractiveness and sexual appeal were widely acknowledged. "He was once beautiful,
        astonishingly beautiful", in the words of critic [[Mark Feeney]].{{sfn|Feeney|2010}} Television director Steve
        Binder, no fan of Presley's music before he oversaw the '68 Comeback Special, reported, "I'm straight as an
        arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking.
        And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd
        know somebody special was in your presence."{{sfn|Ashley|2009|p=76}} His performance style, as much as his
        physical beauty, was responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Writing in 1970, critic [[George Melly]]
        described him as "the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and
        girl."{{sfn|Rodman|1996|p=58}} In his Presley obituary, [[Lester Bangs]] credited him as "the man who brought
        overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America."{{sfn|Rodman|1996|pp=58–59}} Ed Sullivan's
        declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly
        positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.{{sfn|Garber|1997|p=366}}

        While Presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality, some cultural critics have argued that his image was
        ambiguous. In 1959, ''[[Sight and Sound]]''{{'}}s Peter John Dyer described his onscreen persona as
        "aggressively bisexual in appeal".{{Sfn|Dyer|1959–60|p=30}} Brett Farmer places the "orgasmic gyrations" of the
        title dance sequence in ''Jailhouse Rock'' within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a
        "spectacular eroticization, if not homoeroticization, of the male image".{{sfn|Farmer|2000|p=86}} In the
        analysis of Yvonne Tasker, "Elvis was an ambivalent figure who articulated a peculiar feminised, objectifying
        version of white working-class masculinity as aggressive sexual display."{{sfn|Tasker|2007|p=208}}

        Reinforcing Presley's image as a sex symbol were the reports of his dalliances with various Hollywood stars and
        starlets, from [[Natalie Wood]] in the 1950s to [[Connie Stevens]] and [[Ann-Margret]] in the 1960s to [[Candice
        Bergen]] and [[Cybill Shepherd]] in the 1970s. [[June Juanico]] of Memphis, one of Presley's early girlfriends,
        later blamed Parker for encouraging him to choose his dating partners with publicity in mind.{{sfn|Stein|1997}}
        Presley never grew comfortable with the Hollywood scene, and most of these relationships were
        insubstantial.{{sfn|Kirchberg|Hendrickx|1999|p=109}}

        ===Lifestyle===
        [[File:Elvis Presley Pink Cadillac on display.png|thumb|The Pink Cadillac on display in 2012]]
        Presley was known for a life of luxury and excess, as exemplified by his estate at Graceland. He owned a number
        of expensive cars, including [[Elvis Presley's Pink Cadillac|three pink Cadillacs]], immortalized in his version
        of the song "[[Baby, Let's Play House]]", in which Presley replaced the line "you may get religion" with "you
        may have a Pink Cadillac".

        A number of stories, both real and exaggerated, detail Presley's appetite for rich or heavy food. He was said to
        enjoy the [[Southern cuisine]] of his upbringing, including [[chicken-fried steak]] and [[biscuits and gravy]].

        ===Colonel Parker and the Aberbachs===
        {{further|Colonel Tom Parker}}
        [[File:Elvis Presley and Colonel Tom Parker 1969.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of Elvis and Colonel Tom Parker|Presley and
        Colonel Tom Parker, 1969]]
        Once he became Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker insisted on exceptionally tight control over his client's
        career. Songwriter [[Robert B. Sherman]] (of the [[Sherman Brothers]]) bore witness to the deal being forged
        between [[Hill and Range]] co-owner [[Jean Aberbach]] and [[Colonel Tom Parker|The Colonel]] in
        1955.{{sfn|Sherman|2013|pp=313–315}} Early on, "The Colonel" and his Hill and Range allies, the brothers [[Jean
        Aberbach|Jean]] and [[Julian Aberbach]], perceived the close relationship that developed between Presley and
        songwriters [[Jerry Leiber]] and [[Mike Stoller]] as a serious threat to that
        control.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=415–17, 448–49}} Parker effectively ended the relationship, deliberately or not,
        with the new contract he sent Leiber in early 1958. Leiber thought there was a mistake—the sheet of paper was
        blank except for Parker's signature and a line on which to enter his. "There's no mistake, boy, just sign it and
        return it," Parker directed. "Don't worry, we'll fill it in later." Leiber declined, and Presley's fruitful
        collaboration with the writing team was over.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=452–53}} Other respected songwriters lost
        interest in or simply avoided writing for Presley because of the requirement that they surrender a third of
        their usual royalties.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=198}}

        By 1967, Parker's contracts with Presley gave him 50 percent of most of the singer's earnings from recordings,
        films, and merchandise.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=248}} Beginning in February 1972, he took a third of the profit
        from live appearances;{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=304, 365}} a January 1976 agreement entitled him to half
        of that as well.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=358, 375}} Priscilla Presley noted that, "Elvis detested the
        business side of his career. He would sign a contract without even reading it."{{sfn|Presley|1985|p=188}}
        Presley's friend Marty Lacker regarded Parker as a "hustler and a con artist. He was only interested in 'now
        money'—get the buck and get gone."{{sfn|Nash|2005|p=290}}

        Lacker was instrumental in convincing Presley to record with Memphis producer [[Chips Moman]] and his handpicked
        musicians at American Sound Studio in early 1969. The American Sound sessions represented a significant
        departure from the control customarily exerted by Hill and Range. Moman still had to deal with the publisher's
        staff on site, whose song suggestions he regarded as unacceptable. He was on the verge of quitting, until
        Presley ordered the Hill and Range personnel out of the studio.{{sfn|Clayton|Heard|2003|pp=262–65}} Although RCA
        executive Joan Deary was later full of praise for the producer's song choices and the quality of the
        recordings,{{sfn|Clayton|Heard|2003|p=267}} Moman, to his fury, received neither credit on the records nor
        royalties for his work.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=281}}

        Throughout his entire career, Presley performed in only three venues outside the United States—all of them in
        Canada, during brief tours there in 1957. Rumors that he would play overseas for the first time were fueled in
        1974 by a million-dollar bid for an Australian tour. Parker was uncharacteristically reluctant, prompting those
        close to Presley to speculate about the manager's past and the reasons for his apparent unwillingness to apply
        for a passport. Parker ultimately squelched any notions Presley had of working abroad, claiming that foreign
        security was poor and the venues unsuitable for a star of his magnitude.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=123}}

        Parker arguably exercised tightest control over Presley's film career. In 1957, [[Robert Mitchum]] asked Presley
        to costar with him in ''[[Thunder Road (film)|Thunder Road]]'', on which Mitchum was writer and
        producer.{{sfn|Brown|Broeske|1997|p=125}} According to George Klein, one of his oldest friends, Presley was
        offered starring roles in ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'' and ''[[Midnight
        Cowboy]]''.{{sfn|Clayton|Heard|2003|p=226}} In 1974, [[Barbra Streisand]] approached Presley to star with her in
        the remake of ''[[A Star Is Born (1976 film)|A Star is Born]]''.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=563–65}} In each case,
        any ambitions the singer may have had to play such parts were thwarted by his manager's negotiating demands or
        flat refusals. In Lacker's description, "The only thing that kept Elvis going after the early years was a new
        challenge. But Parker kept running everything into the ground."{{sfn|Nash|2005|p=290}} The prevailing attitude
        may have been summed up best by the response Leiber and Stoller received when they brought a serious film
        project for Presley to Parker and the Hill and Range owners for their consideration. In Leiber's telling, Jean
        Aberbach warned them to never again "try to interfere with the business or artistic workings of the process
        known as Elvis Presley."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=449}}

        ===Memphis Mafia===
        {{Main|Memphis Mafia}}
        In the early 1960s, the circle of friends with whom Presley constantly surrounded himself until his death came
        to be known as the "Memphis Mafia".{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|pp=139–40}} "Surrounded by the[ir] parasitic
        presence", as journalist [[John Harris (critic)|John Harris]] puts it, "it was no wonder that as he slid into
        addiction and torpor, no-one raised the alarm: to them, Elvis was the bank, and it had to remain
        open."{{sfn|Harris|2006}} [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]], who played piano for Presley regularly in
        the last two years of the singer's life, observed his rapidly declining health and the urgent need to address
        it: "But we all knew it was hopeless because Elvis was surrounded by that little circle of people&nbsp;... all
        those so-called friends".{{sfn|Clayton|Heard|2003|p=339}} In the Memphis Mafia's defense, Marty Lacker has said,
        "[Presley] was his own man.&nbsp;... If we hadn't been around, he would have been dead a lot
        earlier."{{sfn|Connelly|2008|p=148}}

        Larry Geller became Presley's hairdresser in 1964. Unlike others in the Memphis Mafia, he was interested in
        spiritual questions and recalls how, from their first conversation, Presley revealed his secret thoughts and
        anxieties: "I mean there ''has'' to be a purpose&nbsp;... there's got to be a reason&nbsp;... why I was chosen
        to be Elvis Presley.&nbsp;... I swear to God, no one knows how lonely I get. And how empty I really
        feel."{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=174}} Thereafter, Geller supplied him with books on religion and mysticism, which
        the singer read voraciously.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=175}} Presley would be preoccupied by such matters for much
        of his life, taking trunkloads of books with him on tour.{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}}

        Presley's rise to national attention in 1956 transformed the field of popular music and had a huge effect on the
        broader scope of popular culture.{{sfn|Collins|2002}} As the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock
        and roll, he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth
        culture and rebellious attitude.{{sfn|Sadie|1994|p=638}} With its racially mixed origins—repeatedly affirmed by
        Presley—rock and roll's occupation of a central position in mainstream American culture facilitated a new
        acceptance and appreciation of black culture.{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=94}} In this regard, Little Richard said of
        Presley, "He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He opened the door
        for black music."{{sfn|Rodman|1996|p=193}} [[Al Green]] agreed: "He broke the ice for all of
        us."{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=356}} President [[Jimmy Carter]] remarked on his legacy in 1977: "His music and his
        personality, fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues, permanently changed the face of
        American popular culture. His following was immense, and he was a symbol to people the world over of the
        vitality, rebelliousness, and good humor of his country."{{sfn|Woolley|Peters|1977}} Presley also heralded the
        vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication: at the age of 21, within a year of his
        first appearance on American network television, he was one of the most famous people in the
        world.{{sfn|Arnett|2006|p=400}}

        of jail".{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=356}}

        On the 25th anniversary of Presley's death, ''The New York Times'' observed, "All the talentless impersonators
        and appalling black velvet paintings on display can make him seem little more than a perverse and distant
        memory. But before Elvis was camp, he was its opposite: a genuine cultural force.&nbsp;... Elvis's breakthroughs
        are underappreciated because in this rock-and-roll age, his hard-rocking music and sultry style have triumphed
        so completely."{{sfn|''The New York Times''|2002}} Not only Presley's achievements, but his failings as well,
        are seen by some cultural observers as adding to the power of his legacy, as in this description by Greil
        Marcus:
        <blockquote>

            Elvis Presley is a supreme figure in American life, one whose presence, no matter how banal or predictable,
            brooks no real comparisons.&nbsp;... The cultural range of his music has expanded to the point where it
            includes not only the hits of the day, but also patriotic recitals, pure country gospel, and really dirty
            blues.&nbsp;... Elvis has emerged as a great ''artist,'' a great ''rocker,'' a great ''purveyor of
            schlock,'' a great ''heart throb,'' a great ''bore,'' a great ''symbol of potency,'' a great ''ham,'' a
            great ''nice person,'' and, yes, a great American.{{sfn|Marcus|1982|pp=141–42}}

        {{See also|List of songs recorded by Elvis Presley|List of Elvis Presley hit singles|List of Elvis Presley hit
        albums}}

        A vast number of recordings have been issued under Presley's name. The total number of his original master
        recordings has been variously calculated as 665{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=438}} and 711.{{sfn|Feeney|2010}} His career
        began and he was most successful during an era when singles were the primary commercial medium for pop music. In
        the case of his albums, the distinction between "official" studio records and other forms is often blurred. For
        most of the 1960s, his recording career focused on soundtrack albums. In the 1970s, his most heavily promoted
        and best-selling LP releases tended to be concert albums. This summary discography lists only the albums and
        singles that reached the top of one or more of the following charts: the main U.S. ''Billboard'' pop chart; the
        ''Billboard'' country chart, the genre chart with which he was most identified (there was no country album chart
        before 1964); and the official British pop chart.

        The year given, in the table below, is the year the record first reached number one, rather than its original
        year of release. For instance: ''Elvis' 40 Greatest'', released in 1974, a compilation on the budget Arcade
        label, was the fourth highest selling album of the year in the United Kingdom; at the time, the main British
        chart did not rank such compilations, relegating them to a chart for midpriced and TV-advertised albums, which
        ''Elvis' 40 Greatest'' topped for 15 weeks.{{sfn|Mawer|2007a}} The policy was altered in 1975, allowing the
        album to hit number one on the main chart in 1977, following Presley's death.{{sfn|Mawer|2007b}}

        Before late 1958, rather than unified pop and country singles charts, ''Billboard'' had as many as four charts
        for each, separately ranking records according to sales, jukebox play, jockey spins (i.e., airplay), and, in the
        case of pop, a general "Top 100". ''Billboard'' now regards the sales charts as definitive for the period.
        Widely cited chart statistician Joel Whitburn accords historical releases the highest ranking they achieved
        among the separate charts. Presley discographer Ernst Jorgensen refers only to the Top 100 chart for pop hits.
        All of the 1956–58 songs listed here as number one US pop hits reached the top of both the sales and with three
        exceptions, the Top 100 charts: "I Want You, I Need You, I Love You" (three), "Hound Dog" (two, behind its flip
        side, "Don't Be Cruel"), and "Hard Headed Woman" (two).

        Several Presley singles reached number one in the United Kingdom as double A-sides; in the United States, the
        respective sides of those singles were ranked separately by ''Billboard''.{{refn|(1) The year given is the year
        the record first reached number one, rather than its original year of release. For instance, in 1974, ''Elvis'
        40 Greatest'', a compilation on the budget Arcade label, was the fourth highest selling album of the year in the
        United Kingdom; at the time, the main British chart did not rank such compilations, relegating them to a chart
        for midpriced and TV-advertised albums, which ''Elvis' 40 Greatest'' topped for 15 weeks.{{sfn|Mawer|2007a}} The
        policy was altered in 1975, allowing the album to hit number one on the main chart in 1977, following Presley's
        death.{{sfn|Mawer|2007b}} (2) Before late 1958, rather than unified pop and country singles charts,
        ''Billboard'' had as many as four charts for each, separately ranking records according to sales, jukebox play,
        jockey spins (i.e., airplay), and, in the case of pop, a general Top 100. ''Billboard'' now regards the sales
        charts as definitive for the period. Widely cited chart statistician Joel Whitburn accords historical releases
        the highest ranking they achieved among the separate charts. Presley discographer Ernst Jorgensen refers only to
        the Top 100 chart for pop hits. All of the 1956–58 songs listed here as number one U.S. pop hits reached the top
        of both the sales and, with three exceptions, the Top 100 charts: "I Want You, I Need You, I Love You" (three),
        "Hound Dog" (two, behind its flip side, "Don't Be Cruel"), and "Hard Headed Woman" (two). (3) Several Presley
        singles reached number one in the United Kingdom as double A-sides; in the United States, the respective sides
        of those singles were ranked separately by ''Billboard''.|name=superlatives|group=lower-alpha}} In the United
        States, Presley also had five or six number-one R&B singles and seven number-one adult contemporary
        singles;{{refn|Whitburn calculates a total of six number one R&B singles, including "Don't Be Cruel", released
        as a double A-side with "Hound Dog";{{sfn|Whitburn|2004|pp=500–01}} ''Billboard''{{'}}s Keith Caulfield excludes
        "Don't Be Cruel".{{sfn|Caulfield|2004|p=24}}
        |name=dontbecruel|group=lower-alpha}} in 1964, his "[[Blue Christmas (song)|Blue Christmas]]" topped the
        Christmas singles chart during a period when ''Billboard'' did not rank holiday singles in its primary pop
        chart.{{sfn|Caulfield|2004|p=24}}{{sfn|Whitburn|2004|pp=500–01}} He also had number-one hits in many countries
        beside the US and UK.
