        ==History==
[[Redirect article 2]]
        WOWOW! began in the back of the Joiners Arms in [[Camberwell]] in 2003 as a performance night in a pub by Hanna Hanra and [[Matthew Stone]]. In 2004, the collective squatted a large [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] co-op in Peckham South East London and made it into an artist run space. They include fashion designer [[Gareth Pugh]],<ref name=timeout>[http://www.timeout.com/london/art/features/2885.html "Peckham art squats"], ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'', 8 May 2007.

        In 2003, !WOWOW! organised warehouse parties in [[Peckham]].<ref>Knight, Sam [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/21/fashion/21Rave.html?ex=1177560000&en=28e348cac2b53024&ei=5087 "Hope you saved your glow stick"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', 21 January 2007.

        The second show by the collective in December 2004 was of paintings, film, photography and performance by recent [[Slade School of Art|Slade]] graduates for a month in the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] building at 251 Rye Lane, Peckham, formerly occupied by the [[The Co-operative Group|Co-op]] shop, which the artists gutted and refurbished.<ref name=hoggard>Hoggard, Liz.

        In November 2005, the Children of !WOWOW! organised a week-long event in a large warehouse in Peckham, curated by member Gareth Cadwallader, and in a number of smaller venues in the area, featuring members of the collective and also [[Mark McGowan (performance artist)|Mark McGowan]].<ref name=watkins/> Events included ''Stolen Cinema'' with cult films from a local rental shop, [[Richard Elms]]' play ''Factory Dog'', and a ''Greasy Spoon Art Salon Breakfast'' presided over by Lali Chetwynd and Zoe Brown.<ref name=watkins/> he week culminated with a party for 1,500 people, with 10,000 bottles of beer, 500 bottles of [[whiskey]], and 13 live bands on stage. The bands included The So Silage Crew, Ludes, The Long Blondes, and Ivich Lives.<ref name=watkins/>

        {{quote|text=It was an opportunity to invest in what we believed in, rather than chipping off bits of our soul working as unpaid interns.

        Since the Imperials left their original building in 2006, They have organised events in Dresden and also squatted a Kwik Fit Garage in Camberwell for an exhibition. Millie Brown and [[Adham Faramawy]] have organised several art and music events. These have included an event in March 2007 in Birmingham. Along with the original group, several other artists and performers exhibited, including [[Theo Adams]], [[Ben Schumacher]], [[Lennie Lee]], and Fayann Smith.

Its capital and most populous city is [[Algiers]]. With a total area of {{convert|2381741|km2|sqmi|0}}, 90% of which is desert, Algeria is the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|tenth-largest country in the world]], and the largest in Africa and in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html|title=Country Comparison: Area |publisher=CIA World Factbook |date= |accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country is bordered in the northeast by [[Tunisia]], in the east by [[Libya]], in the west by [[Morocco]], in the southwest by [[Western Sahara]], [[Mauritania]], and [[Mali]], in the southeast by [[Niger]], and in the north by the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

The territory of today's Algeria was the home of many prehistoric cultures, including [[Aterian]] and [[Capsian culture|Capsian]] and the [[Proto-Berber language|&quot;Proto-Imaziɣen&quot;]] cultures. Its area has known many empires and dynasties, including ancient [[Berber people|Amaziɣ]] [[Numidia]]ns, [[Phoenecians]], Lybio-Punic [[Punic|Carthaginians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Vandals]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], Arab [[Umayyad]]s, Arab [[Abbasid]]s, Multi-Ethnic [[Fatimid]]s, [[Berber people|Amaziɣ]] [[Almoravids]], [[Berber people|Amaziɣ]] [[Almohads]], [[Ottoman Turks|Turkish]] Ottomans and the [[French Algeria|French colonial empire]]. In recent decades Algeria along with the other nations of the &quot;Desert Belt&quot; has experienced an identity crisis, in response Algeria, along with Morocco, has nationalized [[Tamaziɣt]] the language of its 13,000 year old people.  Algeria is a [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential republic]], it consists of 48 provinces and 1541 communes. With a population of 37.9 million, it is the 35th most populated country on Earth. [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]] has been the [[President of Algeria]] since 1999 and has won four consecutive elections. However, according to the [[Democracy Index]] Algeria is an [[authoritarian regime]].

In the region of Ain Hanech ([[Saïda Province]]), early remnants (200,000 BC) of hominid occupation in North Africa were found. Neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the [[Levallois technique|Levalloisian]] and [[Mousterian]] styles (43,000 BC) similar to those in the [[Levant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gi.ulpgc.es/tarha/Ain_Hanech.pdf |title=The Site of Ain Hanech Revisited: New Investigations at this Lower Pleistocene Site in Northern Algeria |publisher=Journal of Archaeological Science |author=Sahnouni, Mohamed and de Heinzelin, Jean |accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoneageinstitute.org/ain-hanech.html |title=Research at Ain Hanech, Algeria |publisher=Stoneageinstitute.org |date= |accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algeria was the site of the highest state of development of [[Middle Paleolithic]] [[Flake tool]] techniques. Tools of this era, starting about 30,000 BC, are called [[Aterian]] (after the archeological site of [[Bir el Ater]], south of [[Tebessa]]).

The earliest blade industries in North Africa are called [[Iberomaurusian]] (located mainly in [[Oran]] region). This industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the [[Maghreb]] between 15,000 and 10,000 BC. Neolithic civilization (animal domestication and agriculture) developed in the Saharan and Mediterranean Maghreb perhaps as early as 11,000 BC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1002397 |title=Genomic Ancestry of North Africans Supports Back-to-Africa Migrations |publisher=PLOS Genetics |date=2012-01-12 |accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as late as between 6000 and 2000 BC. This life, richly depicted in the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] paintings, predominated in Algeria until the classical period.

The amalgam of peoples of North Africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called [[Berber people|Berbers]], who are the indigenous peoples of northern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Berbers|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|year=1997|chapter=Berbers in Antiquity|isbn=978-0-631-20767-2|url=http://books.google.com/?id=8Zcz91t29ukC|author=Brett, Michael; Fentress, Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From their principal center of power at Carthage, the [[Carthaginians]] expanded and established small settlements along the North African coast; by 600 BC, a [[Phoenicia]]n presence existed at [[Tipasa]], east of [[Cherchell]], [[Hippo Regius]] (modern [[Annaba]]) and [[Rusicade]] (modern [[Skikda]]). These settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages.

As Carthaginian power grew, its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically. Berber civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organization supported several states. Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others.

[[File:Egypt, Rome, Carthage and Numidia.jpg|thumbnail|right|Numidia along with Egypt, Rome, and Carthage 200 BCE]]

By the early 4th century BC, Berbers formed the single largest element of the Carthaginian army. In the [[Mercenary War|Revolt of the Mercenaries]], Berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 BC after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the [[First Punic War]]. They succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage's North African territory, and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan, used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa. The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the [[Punic Wars]].

In 146 BC the city of [[Carthage]] was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in [[Numidia]], behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay [[Mauretania]], which extended across the [[Moulouya River]] in modern day [[Morocco]] to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilization, unequaled until the coming of the [[Almohads]] and [[Almoravids]] more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of [[Massinissa]] in the 2nd century BC.

After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times. Massinissa's line survived until 24 AD, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the [[Roman Empire]].

For several centuries Algeria was ruled by the Romans, who founded many colonies in the region. Like the rest of North Africa, Algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire, exporting cereals and other agricultural products. The Vandals of [[Geiseric]] moved into North Africa in 429, and by 435 controlled coastal Numidia.&lt;ref name=&quot;vandaf&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Averil|last2=Ward-Perkins|first2=Bryan|title=The Cambridge Ancient History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Qf8mrHjfZRoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA124|volume=14|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-32591-2|pages=124–126|chapter=Vandal Africa, 429–533}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did not make any significant settlement on the land, as they were harassed by local tribes, in fact by the time the Byzantines arrived Lepcis Magna was abandoned and the Msellata region was occupied by the indigenous [[Amazigh|Laguatan]] who had been busy facilitating an [[Amazigh|Amaziɣ]] political, military and cultural revival.&lt;ref name=&quot;vandaf&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mattingly|first1=D.J.|title=The Laguatan: A Libyan Tribal Confederation in the late Roman Empire.|journal=Libyan Studies|date=1983|volume=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FatimidCaliphate969.png|thumb|[[Fatimid Caliphate]] 969 A.D.]]
After fierce resistance from the locals the Muslims conquered Algeria in the mid-7th century and a large number of the indigenous people converted to the new faith. After the fall of the [[Umayyad]] Caliphate in 751, numerous local dynasties emerged, including the [[Aghlabids]], [[Almohads]], [[Abdalwadid]], [[Zirids]], [[Rustamids]], [[Hammadids]], [[Almoravids]] and the [[Fatimids]].

During the Middle Ages North Africa and Algeria more specifically was home to many great Scholars, Saints and Sovereigns including [[Judah ibn Kuraish|Judah Ibn Quryash]] the first grammarian to suggest the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic Language Family]] the great Sufi masters [[Abu Madyan|Sidi Boumediene (Abu Madyan)]] and [[Sidi El Houari]], as well as the Emirs [[Abd al-Mu'min]] and [[Yaghmurasen Ibn Zyan|Yāghmūrasen]]. It was during this time period that the [[Fatimids]] or children of Fatima daughter of Muhammad, according to Fatimid claims came to the Maghreb. These &quot;Fatimids&quot; went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the Maghreb, Hejaz, and the Levant, boasting a secular inner government, as well as a powerful army and navy, primarily made up of the native North Africans or the [[Berber people|Imāziɣen]]. The [[Fatimid caliphate]] began to collapse when it's African governors the [[Zirids]] seceded. In order to punish them the Fatimids sent the Arab [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]] against them. The resultant war is recounted in the epic [[Taghribat Bani Hilal|Tāghribāt]]. In Al-Tāghrībāt the Amāzīɣ Zirid Hero [[Khalifa al-Zanati|Khālīfā Al-Zānatī]] asks daily, for duels, defeating the Hilalan hero [[Abu Zayd al-Hilali|Ābu Zayd al-Hilalī]] and many other Arab knights in a string of victories. The [[Zirid]]s however were unexpectedly defeated ushering in an influx of Arab customs and culture. The Indigenous [[Berber people|Imaziɣen]] however remained largely independent, and depending on tribe, location, and time controlled varying parts of the Maghreb, at times unifying it (as under the Fatimids) as well as overseas conquests of Portugal, Senegal, Spain, Sicily, Egypt, Sudan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Iraq, and Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/202580/Fatimid-Dynasty/2238/Conquest-of-Egypt|title=Fatimid Dynasty (Islamic dynasty)|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_carte.php?carte=carte-05 |title=Qantara |publisher=Qantara-med.org |date= |accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=595 |title=Qantara - Les Almoravides (1056-1147) |publisher=Qantara-med.org |date= |accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caliphates from Northern Africa traded tit for tat with the other empires of their time, as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other Islamic states during the highly competitive Islamic Era.

The [[Berber people|Imaziɣen]] historically consisted of several tribes. The two main branches were the Botr and Barnès tribes, who were divided into tribes, and again into sub-tribes. Each region of the Maghreb contained several tribes (for example, [[Sanhadja]], Houaras, [[Zenata]], [[Masmuda|Masmouda]], Kutama, Awarba, and [[Berghwata]]). All these tribes made independent territorial decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=H3RBAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR2|title=Histoire des Berbères et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique Septentrionale Par Ibn Khaldūn, William MacGuckin Slane| trans_title =History of the Berbers and the Muslim dynasties of northern Africa | language= French |page=XV|author=Khaldūn, Ibn|year=1852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[Berber people|Imaziɣen]] dynasties emerged during the Middle Ages in the Maghreb and other nearby lands.

In the early 16th century, Spain constructed fortified outposts ([[presidio]]s) on or near the Algerian coast. Spain took control of [[Mers el Kebir]] in 1505; [[Oran]] in 1509; and [[Tlemcen]], [[Mostaganem]], and [[Ténès]], in 1510. In the same year, the merchants of Algiers ceded one of the rocky islets in their harbor to Spain, which built a fort on it. The presidios in North Africa turned out to be a costly and largely ineffective military endeavor that did not guarantee access for Spain's merchant fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Offensive|url=http://countrystudies.us/algeria/14.htm|publisher=Country Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman Algeria===
{{main|Ottoman Algeria}}
[[File:Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hayreddin Barbarossa]]]]
[[File:Old algiers 16th century.jpg|thumb|Old [[Algiers]] in the 16th century, with the Spanish-built [[Peñón of Algiers]] in the forefront]]
In 1516 the Muslim privateer brothers [[Aruj]] and [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]], who operated successfully under the [[Hafsids]], moved their base of operations to Algiers. When Aruj was killed in 1518 during his invasion of [[Kingdom of Tlemcen|Tlemcen]], Hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of Algiers. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultan gave him the title of [[beylerbey]] and a contingent of some 2,000 [[janissaries]]. With the aid of this force, Hayreddin sub-dued the coastal region between Constantine and Oran (although the city of Oran remained in Spanish hands until 1791).&lt;ref name=&quot;csa16&quot; /&gt;

The next beylerbey was Hayreddin's son [[Hasan Pasha (son of Barbarossa)|Hasan]], who assumed the position in 1544. Until 1587 the area was governed by officers who served terms with no fixed limits. Subsequently, with the institution of a regular Ottoman administration, governors with the title of pasha ruled for three-year terms. The pasha was assisted by janissaries, known in Algeria as the ojaq and led by an [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|agha]]. Discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid-1600s because they were not paid regularly, and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha. As a result, the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa16&quot; /&gt;

[[Plague (disease)|Plague]] had repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa. Algiers lost from 30,000 to 50,000 inhabitants to the plague in 1620–21, and suffered high fatalities in 1654–57, 1665, 1691, and 1740–42.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis&quot; /&gt;

In 1671, the [[taifa]] rebelled, killed the agha, and placed one of its own in power. The new leader received the title of [[dey]]. After 1689, the right to select the dey passed to the [[divan]], a council of some sixty notables. It was at first dominated by the ''[[ojaq]]''; but by the 18th century, it had become the dey's instrument. In 1710, the dey persuaded the sultan to recognize him and his successors as regent, replacing the [[pasha]] in that role. Although Algiers remained a part of the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman government ceased to have effective influence there.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa16&quot; /&gt;

The dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat. The dey was elected for a life term, but in the 159 years (1671–1830) that the system survived, fourteen of the twenty-nine deys were assassinated. Despite usurpation, military coups, and occasional mob rule, the day-to-day operation of government was remarkably orderly. Although the regency patronized the tribal chieftains, it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside, where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest. Autonomous tribal states were tolerated, and the regency's authority was seldom applied in the [[Kabylie]].&lt;ref name=&quot;csa16&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Algeria&amp;nbsp;– Ottoman Rule|url=http://countrystudies.us/algeria/16.htm|publisher=Country Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1544, Hayreddin captured the island of [[Ischia]], taking 4,000 prisoners, and enslaved some 9,000 inhabitants of [[Lipari]], almost the entire population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/26/style/26iht-trsic_ed3_.html |title=The Mysteries and Majesties of the Aeolian Islands |work=International Herald Tribune | first=Elisabetta |last=Povoledo |date=26 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1551, [[Turgut Reis]] enslaved the entire population of the Maltese island of [[Gozo]], between 5,000 and 6,000, sending the captives to Libya.

In 1558, Barbary corsairs captured the town of [[Ciutadella]] (Minorca), destroyed it, slaughtered the inhabitants and took 3,000 survivors as slaves to [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holidays2menorca.com/history.php |title=History of Menorca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbary pirates often attacked the [[Balearic Islands]], and in response, the residents built many coastal watchtowers and fortified churches.

Between 1609 to 1616, England lost 466 merchant ships to Barbary pirates.&lt;ref name=&quot;barbary&quot;/&gt; In the 19th century, the pirates forged affiliations with Caribbean powers, paying a &quot;license tax&quot; in exchange for safe harbor of their vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mackie|first=Erin Skye|title=Welcome the Outlaw: Pirates, Maroons, and Caribbean Countercultures|journal=Cultural Critique|date=1 January 2005|volume=59|issue=1|pages=24–62|doi=10.1353/cul.2005.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt; One American slave reported that the Algerians had enslaved 130 American seamen in the Mediterranean and Atlantic from 1785 to 1793.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/history/American_and_Military/Barbary_Pirates/Britannica_1911*.html |title=Barbary Pirates&amp;nbsp;– Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piracy on American vessels in the Mediterranean resulted in the United States initiating the [[First Barbary War|First]] (1801–1805) and [[Second Barbary War]]s (1815). Following those wars, Algeria was weaker, and Europeans, with an Anglo-Dutch fleet commanded by the British [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Lord Exmouth]], [[Bombardment of Algiers (1816)|attacked Algiers]]. After a nine-hour bombardment, they obtained a treaty from the Dey that reaffirmed the conditions imposed by [[Stephen Decatur|Decatur]] (US navy) concerning the demands of tributes. In addition, the Dey agreed to end the practice of enslaving Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Littell, Eliakim  |title=The Museum of foreign literature, science and art |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=48L1w21XYI4C&amp;pg=PA231 |year=1836 |publisher=E.

From 1848 until independence, France administered the whole Mediterranean region of Algeria as an integral part and département of the nation. One of France's longest-held overseas territories, Algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of [[European ethnic groups|European]] immigrants, who became known as ''colons'' and later, as ''[[Pied-Noir]]s.'' Between 1825 and 1847, 50,000 French people emigrated to Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Randell|first=Keith|title=France: Monarchy, Republic and Empire, 1814–70|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AvyGHAAACAAJ|year=1986|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|isbn=978-0-340-51805-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2013}} These settlers benefited from the French government's confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples, and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Horne, Alistair |title=A Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954–1962 (New York Review Books Classics) |publisher=NYRB Classics |location=1755 Broadway, New York, NY 10019 |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-59017-218-6 |oclc=|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gradually, dissatisfaction among the Muslim population, which lacked political and economic status in the colonial system, gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy, and eventually independence, from France. Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954, when the first violent events of what was later called the [[Algerian War]] began. Historians have estimated that between 30,000 and 150,000 [[Harkis]] and their dependents were killed by the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de Libération Nationale]] (FLN) or by [[lynching|lynch]] mobs in Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7130307.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=French 'Reparation' for Algerians | date=6 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FLN used terrorist attacks in Algeria and France as part of its war, and the French conducted severe reprisals and repression. The war concluded in 1962, when Algeria gained complete independence following the March 1962 [[Evian agreements]] and the July 1962 [[Algerian self-determination referendum, 1962|self-determination referendum]].

===Independence===
{{main|History of Algeria (1962–99)}}
[[File:Houari Boumediene's Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Houari Boumediene]]]]
Algeria's first president was the FLN leader [[Ahmed Ben Bella]]. Morocco's claim to [[Greater Morocco|portions of western Algeria]] led to the [[Sand War]] in 1963. Ben Bella was overthrown in 1965 by [[Houari Boumediene]], his former ally and defense minister. Under Ben Bella, the government had become increasingly socialist and [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]]; Boumédienne continued this trend. But, he relied much more on the army for his support, and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role. He [[collective farming|collectivised]] agriculture and launched a massive industrialization drive. [[Extraction of petroleum|Oil extraction]] facilities were nationalized. This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international [[1973 oil crisis]].

In the 1960s and 1970s under President Houari Boumediene, Algeria pursued a programme of industrialisation within a state-controlled socialist economy. Boumediene's successor, [[Chadli Bendjedid]], introduced some liberal economic reforms. He promoted a policy of [[Arabisation]] in Algerian society and public life. Teachers of Arabic, brought in from other Muslim countries, spread radical Islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of political Islamism.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

The Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil, leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the [[1980s oil glut]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Prochaska|first=David|title=That Was Then, This Is Now: The Battle of Algiers and After.|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/rhr/summary/v085/85.1prochaska.html|page=141|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in Algerian social unrest during the 1980s; by the end of the decade, Bendjedid introduced a multi-party system. Political parties developed, such as the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] (FIS), a broad coalition of Islamist groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

===Civil War and aftermath===
{{main|Algerian Civil War}}

In December 1991 the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] dominated the first of two rounds of [[Algerian legislative election, 1991|legislative elections]]. Fearing the election of an Islamist government, the authorities intervened on 11 January 1992, cancelling the elections. Bendjedid resigned and a [[High Council of State (Algeria)|High Council of State]] was installed to act as Presidency. It banned the FIS, triggering a civil [[insurgency]] between the Front's armed wing, the [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], and the national armed forces, in which more than 100,000 persons are thought to have died. The Islamist militants conducted a violent campaign of [[List of massacres during the Algerian Civil War|civilian massacres]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/30/world/98-die-in-one-of-algerian-civil-war-s-worst-massacres.html 98 Die in One of Algerian Civil War's Worst Massacres ]&quot;. ''The New York Times''. 30 August 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; At several points in the conflict, the situation in Algeria became a point of international concern, most notably during the crisis surrounding [[Air France Flight 8969]], a hijacking perpetrated by the Armed Islamic Group. The Armed Islamic Group declared a ceasefire in October 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

Algeria held [[Algerian presidential election, 1999|elections in 1999]], considered biased by international observers and most opposition groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/algeria#.Ut_5Aig4m2w |title = Freedom in the World 2013: Algeria|publisher = Freedom House| author = &quot;Freedom House&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were won by President [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]]. He worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a 'Civil Concord' initiative, approved in a [[Algerian Civil Concord referendum, 1999|referendum]], under which many political prisoners were pardoned, and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty, in force until 13 January 2000. The AIS disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly. The [[Groupe Salafiste pour la Prédication et le Combat]] (GSPC), a splinter group of the Group Islamic Armée, continued a terrorist campaign against the Government.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

[[File:A Market in Algeria.jpg|thumb|Algeria is seemingly stable but popular angst is rapidly growing against the governing elite.]]
Bouteflika was re-elected in the [[Algerian presidential election, 2004|April 2004 presidential election]] after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation. The programme comprised economic, institutional, political and social reform to modernise the country, raise living standards, and tackle the causes of alienation. It also included a second amnesty initiative, the [[Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation]], which was approved in a [[Algerian national reconciliation referendum, 2005|referendum in September 2005]]. It offered amnesty to most guerrillas and Government security forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

In November 2008, the [[Algerian Constitution]] was amended following a vote in Parliament, removing the two-term limit on Presidential incumbents. This change enabled Bouteflika to stand for re-election in the [[Algerian presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential elections]], and he was re-elected in April 2009. During his election campaign and following his re-election, Bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a $150-billion spending programme to create three million new jobs, the construction of one million new housing units, and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

A continuing series of protests throughout the country started on 28 December 2010, inspired by similar [[Arab Spring|protests across the Middle East and North Africa]].

Algeria is the largest country in Africa, the [[Arab world]], and the [[Mediterranean Basin]]. Its southern part includes a significant portion of the [[Sahara]]. To the north, the [[Tell Atlas]] form with the [[Saharan Atlas]], further south, two parallel sets of reliefs in approaching eastbound, and between which are inserted vast plains and highlands. Both Atlas tend to merge in eastern Algeria. The vast mountain ranges of [[Aures]] and [[Tebessa|Nememcha]] occupy the entire northeastern Algeria and are delineated by the Tunisian border. The highest point is [[Mount Tahat]] ({{formatnum: 3003}} m).
[[File:Algeria relief.png|thumb|The [[Sahara]], the [[Ahaggar Mountains|Ahaggar]] and the [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas]] mountains compose the Algerian relief]]
Algeria lies mostly between latitudes [[19th parallel north|19°]] and [[37th parallel north|37°N]] (a small area is north of 37°), and longitudes [[9th meridian west|9°W]] and [[12th meridian east|12°E]]. Most of the coastal area is hilly, sometimes even mountainous, and there are a few natural [[harbour]]s. The area from the coast to the Tell Atlas is fertile. South of the Tell Atlas is a [[steppe]] landscape ending with the [[Saharan Atlas]]; farther south, there is the Sahara desert.&lt;ref name=LOC&gt;{{cite web|last=Metz|first=Helen Chapin|title=Algeria : a country study|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/dztoc.html|publisher=United States Library of Congress|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ahaggar Mountains]] ({{lang-ar|جبال هقار}}), also known as the Hoggar, are a highland region in central Sahara, southern Algeria. They are located about {{convert|1500|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the capital, Algiers, and just west of [[Tamanghasset]]. Algiers, [[Oran]], [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]], and [[Annaba]] are Algeria's main cities.&lt;ref name=LOC /&gt;

===Climate and hydrology===
{{Main|Climate of Algeria}}
[[File:Hoggar8.jpg|thumb|An oasis in the [[Hoggar]]]]
[[File:Agoulmime.jpg|thumb|left|Lake Agoulmime, [[Tikjda]].]]

In this region, midday desert temperatures can be hot year round. After sunset, however, the clear, dry air permits rapid loss of heat, and the nights are cool to chilly. Enormous daily ranges in temperature are recorded.

The highest official temperature was {{convert|50.6|°C|°F}} at In Salah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extreme Weather&amp;nbsp;– A Guide and Record Book|url=http://www.mherrera.org/temp.htm|publisher=W.W. Norton Press|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5mgEKD3NJ|archivedate=10 January 2010|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rainfall is fairly plentiful along the coastal part of the Tell Atlas, ranging from {{convert|400|to|670|mm|1|abbr=on}} annually, the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is heaviest in the northern part of eastern Algeria, where it reaches as much as {{convert|1000|mm|1|abbr=on}} in some years.

Farther inland, the rainfall is less plentiful. Algeria also has [[erg (landform)|ergs]], or sand dunes, between mountains. Among these, in the summer time when winds are heavy and gusty, temperatures can get up to {{convert|110|°F|°C|1|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Fauna and flora===
{{Main|Wildlife of Algeria}}
[[File:Cèdre du Chélia 13 (Algeria).jpg|thumb|left|[[Cedrus]] of Chélia in the [[Aures]]]]
The varied vegetation of Algeria includes [[coastal]], [[mountainous]] and grassy [[desert]]-like regions which all support a wide range of wildlife. Many of the creatures comprising the Algerian wildlife live in close proximity to civilization. The most commonly seen animals include the wild [[boar]]s, [[jackal]]s, and [[gazelle]]s, although it is not uncommon to spot [[fennecs]] (foxes), and [[jerboas]]. Algeria also has a few, [[leopard]] and [[cheetah]] populations, but these are seldom seen.

A variety of bird species makes the country an attraction for bird watchers. The forests are inhabited by boars and jackals. [[Barbary macaque]]s are the sole native monkey. Snakes, [[monitor lizard]]s, and numerous other reptiles can be found living among an array of [[rodent]]s throughout the [[semi arid]] regions of Algeria. Many animals are now extinct, among which the [[Barbary lion]]s and bears.

In the north, some of the native flora includes [[Macchia]] scrub, [[olive trees]], [[oak]]s, [[cedrus|cedars]] and other [[conifers]]. The mountain regions contain large forests of evergreens ([[Aleppo pine]], [[juniper]], and [[evergreen oak]]) and some deciduous trees. [[Ficus|Fig]], [[eucalyptus]], [[agave]], and various [[palm trees]] grow in the warmer areas. The [[grape vine]] is indigenous to the coast. In the Sahara region, some oases have palm trees. [[Acacias]] with wild [[olives]] are the predominant flora in the remainder of the [[Sahara]].

[[Camel]]s are used extensively; the desert also abounds with poisonous and nonpoisonous snakes, [[scorpion]]s, and numerous insects.

Elected politicians are considered to have relatively little sway over Algeria. Instead, a group of unelected civilian and military &quot;décideurs&quot;, known as &quot;le pouvoir&quot; (&quot;the power&quot;), actually rule the country, even deciding who should be president. The most powerful man may be [[Mohamed Mediène]], head of the military intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Still waiting for real democracy|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21554565|publisher=The Economist|date=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, many of these generals have died or retired. After the death of General [[Larbi Belkheir]], Bouteflika put loyalists in key posts, notably at [[Sonatrach]], and secured constitutional amendments that make him re-electable indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The president and the police|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15612455|publisher=The Economist|date=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The head of state is the president of Algeria, who is elected for a five-year term. The president was formerly limited to two five-year terms, but a constitutional amendment passed by the Parliament on 11 November 2008 removed this limitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7724635.stm |title= Algeria Deputies Scrap Term Limit |publisher=BBC News |date=12 November 2008 |accessdate=24 November 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081114015503/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7724635.stm| archivedate= 14 November 2008 &lt;!-- DASHBot --&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algeria has universal [[suffrage]] at 18 years of age.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlgeriaFactbook&quot;/&gt; The President is the head of the [[Algerian Army|army]], the [[Council of Ministers of Algeria|Council of Ministers]] and the [[High Security Council]].

The Algerian parliament is [[bicameral]]; the lower house, the [[People's National Assembly]], has 462 members who are directly elected for five-year terms, while the upper house, the [[Council of the Nation]], has 144 members serving six-year terms, of which 96 members are chosen by local assemblies and 48 are appointed by the president.&lt;ref name=fitw13 /&gt; According to the [[Constitution of Algeria|constitution]], no political association may be formed if it is &quot;based on differences in religion, language, race, gender, profession or region&quot;.

Parliamentary elections were last held in [[Algerian legislative election, 2012|May 2012]], and were judged to be largely free by international monitors, though local groups alleged fraud and irregularities.&lt;ref name=fitw13&gt;{{cite web|title=Algeria|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/algeria|work=Freedom in the World 2013|publisher=Freedom House|accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the elections, the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] won 221 seats, the military-backed [[National Rally for Democracy (Algeria)|National Rally for Democracy]] won 70, and the Islamist [[Green Algeria Alliance]] won 47.&lt;ref name=fitw13/&gt;

Tensions between Algeria and Morocco in relation to the [[Western Sahara]] have been an obstacle to tightening the [[Arab Maghreb Union]], nominally established in 1989, but which has carried little practical weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/990219/1999021906.html |publisher=ArabicNews.com |title=Bin Ali calls for reactivating Arab Maghreb Union, Tunisia-Maghreb, Politics |date=19 February 1999 |accessdate=4 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algeria is included in the European Union's [[European Neighbourhood Policy]] (ENP) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer.
Giving incentives and rewarding best performers, as well as offering funds in a faster and more flexible manner, are the two main principles underlying the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) that came into force in 2014. It has a budget of €15.4 billion and provides the bulk of funding through a number of programmes.

==Provinces and districts==
{{Main|Provinces of Algeria|Districts of Algeria|Municipalities of Algeria}}
Algeria is divided into 48 [[provinces of Algeria|provinces]] (''[[wilaya]]s''), 553 [[districts of Algeria|districts]] (''[[daïra]]s'') and 1,541 [[Municipalities of Algeria|municipalities]] (''[[baladiyah]]s''). Each province, district, and municipality is named after its [[Capital (political)|seat]], which is usually the largest city.

The administrative divisions have changed several times since independence. When introducing new provinces, the numbers of old provinces are kept, hence the non-alphabetical order. With their official numbers, currently (since 1983) they are&lt;ref name=&quot;AlgeriaFactbook&quot;/&gt;

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Algeria}}
[[File:Algeria Export Treemap.jpg|thumb|250px|Graphical depiction of the country's exports in 28 colour-coded categories.]]
Algeria is classified as an upper middle income country by the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DATASTATISTICS/Resources/CLASS.XLS |title=World Bank list of economies |date= January 2011 |publisher=World Bank |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algeria’s currency is the [[Algerian dinar|dinar]] (DZD). The economy remains dominated by the state, a legacy of the country's socialist post-independence development model. In recent years, the Algerian government has halted the privatization of state-owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlgeriaFactbook&quot;/&gt;

Algeria has struggled to develop industries outside hydrocarbons in part because of high costs and an inert state bureaucracy. The government's efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlgeriaFactbook&quot;/&gt; The country is facing a number of short-term and medium-term problems, including the need to diversify the economy, strengthen political, economic and financial reforms, improve the business climate and reduce inequalities amongst regions.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt;

A wave of economic protests in February and March 2011 prompted the Algerian government to offer more than $23 billion in public grants and retroactive salary and benefit increases. Public spending has increased by 27% annually during the past 5 years. The 2010–14 public-investment programme will cost US$286 billion, 40% of which will go to human development.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt;

The Algerian economy grew by 2.6% in 2011, driven by public spending, in particular in the construction and public-works sector, and by growing internal demand. If hydrocarbons are excluded, growth has been estimated at 4.8%. Growth of 3% is expected in 2012, rising to 4.2% in 2013. The rate of inflation was 4% and the budget deficit 3% of GDP. The current-account surplus is estimated at 9.3% of GDP and at the end of December 2011, official reserves were put at US$182 billion.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt; Inflation, the lowest in the region, has remained stable at 4% on average between 2003 and 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;MFW4A&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfw4a.org/algeria/algeria-financial-sector-profile.html |title=Algeria: Financial Sector Profile |publisher=Making Finance Work for Africa |date= |accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Algeria announced a budgetary surplus of $26.9 billion, 62% increase in comparison to 2010 surplus. In general, the country exported $73 billion worth of commodities while it imported $46 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.nuqudy.com/General_Overview/North_Africa/Algeria_Non-Oil_Exp-676 |title=Algeria Non-Oil Exports Surge 41% |publisher=nuqudy.com |date=25 January 2012 |accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to strong hydrocarbon revenues, Algeria has a cushion of $173 billion in [[foreign currency reserves]] and a large hydrocarbon stabilization fund. In addition, Algeria's [[List of countries by external debt|external debt]] is extremely low at about 2% of GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlgeriaFactbook&quot;/&gt; The economy remains very dependent on hydrocarbon wealth, and, despite high foreign exchange reserves (US$178 billion, equivalent to three years of imports), current expenditure growth makes Algeria's budget more vulnerable to the risk of prolonged lower hydrocarbon revenues.&lt;ref name=imfart4/&gt;

In 2011, the agricultural sector and services recorded growth of 10% and 5.3%, respectively.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt; About 14% of the labor force are employed in the [[Agriculture in Algeria|agricultural sector]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AlgeriaFactbook&quot;/&gt; Fiscal policy in 2011 remained expansionist and made it possible to maintain the pace of public investment and to contain the strong demand for jobs and housing.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt;

===Hydrocarbons===
{{see also|Mining industry of Algeria}}
Algeria, whose economy is reliant on petroleum, has been an [[OPEC]] member since 1969. Its crude oil production stands at around 1.1 million barrels/day, but it is also a major gas producer and exporter, with important links to Europe.&lt;ref name=opb15&gt;{{cite web|title=OPEC Bulletin 8-9/12|url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/flipbook/OB08092012/OB08092012/assets/basic-html/page17.html|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP, and over 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the [[List of countries by natural gas proven reserves|10th-largest reserves of natural gas]] in the world and is the [[List of countries by natural gas exports|sixth-largest gas exporter]]. The U.S. [[Energy Information Administration]] reported that in 2005, Algeria had {{convert|160|Tcuft}} of proven [[natural gas reserves|natural-gas reserves]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ciawfb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2253rank.html|title=Country Comparison: Natural Gas – Proved Reserves|publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also ranks [[List of countries by proven oil reserves|16th in oil reserves]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AlgeriaFactbook&quot;/&gt;

Non-hydrocarbon growth for 2011 was projected at 5%. To cope with social demands, the authorities raised expenditure, especially on basic food support, employment creation, support for SMEs, and higher salaries. High hydrocarbon prices have improved the current account and the already large international reserves position.&lt;ref name=imfart4/&gt;

Income from oil and gas rose in 2011 as a result of continuing high oil prices, though the trend in production volume is downwards.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt; Production from the oil and gas sector in terms of volume, continues to decline, dropping from 43.2 million tonnes to 32 million tonnes between 2007 and 2011. Nevertheless, the sector accounted for 98% of the total volume of exports in 2011, against 48% in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsa-algerie.com/actualite/item/622-le-temps-des-crapules |title=Le temps des crapules&amp;nbsp;– Tout sur l'Algérie |publisher=Tsa-algerie.com |date= |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 70% of budgetary receipts, or USD 71.4 billion.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt;

The Algerian national oil company is [[Sonatrach]], which plays a key role in all aspects of the oil and natural gas sectors in Algeria. All foreign operators must work in partnership with Sonatrach, which usually has majority ownership in production-sharing agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Analysis Briefs&amp;nbsp;– Algeria|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531053812/http://www.eia.gov/cabs/Algeria/pdf.pdf|publisher=Energy Information Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a decline in total unemployment, youth and women unemployment is high.&lt;ref name=imfart4&gt;{{cite web|title=Algeria: 2011 Article IV Consultation|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2012/cr1220.pdf|publisher=IMF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unemployment particularly affects the young, with a jobless rate of 21.5% among the 15–24 age group.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt;

The overall rate of unemployment was 10% in 2011, but remained higher among young people, with a rate of 21.5% for those aged between 15 and 24.

===Tourism===
{{Main|Tourism in Algeria}}

The development of the tourism sector in Algeria had previously been hampered by a lack of facilities, but since 2004 a broad tourism development strategy has been implemented resulting in many hotels of a high modern standard being built.

There are several [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]] in Algeria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNESCO|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/dz|accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Al Qal'a of Beni Hammad]], the first capital of the [[Hammadid]] empire; [[Tipasa]], a Phoenician and later Roman town; and [[Djémila]] and [[Timgad]], both [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ruins; [[M'Zab Valley]], a limestone valley containing a large urbanized [[oasis]]; also the [[Casbah]] of Algiers is an important citadel.

[[File:Autoroute est ouest ghomri2.JPG|thumb|The main highway relaying the Moroccan to the Tunisian borders, was a part of the [[Cairo–Dakar Highway]] project]]
The Algerian road network is the most dense of the African continent, its length is estimated at 180,000&amp;nbsp;km of highways, with a rate of more than 3 756 structures and paving of 85%. This network should be complemented by a major highway infrastructure being completed, the East-West Highway. It is a 3-way 1 216&amp;nbsp;km, linking the city of [[Annaba]] in the extreme east to the city of [[Tlemcen]] in the far West. Algeria is also crossed by the [[Trans-Sahara Highway]], which is now totally paved. This road is pushed forward by the Algerian government to increase trade between the six countries crossed (Algeria, [[Mali]], Niger, [[Nigeria]], Chad and [[Tunisia]]).

Modern Algerian literature, split between Arabic, [[Berber languages|Tamazight]] and French, has been strongly influenced by the country's recent history. [[List of Algerian writers|Famous novelists]] of the 20th century include [[Mohammed Dib]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Kateb Yacine]] and [[Ahlam Mosteghanemi]] while [[Assia Djebar]] is widely translated. Among the important novelists of the 1980s were [[Rachid Mimouni]], later vice-president of [[Amnesty International]], and [[Tahar Djaout]], murdered by an [[Islamist]] group in 1993 for his secularist views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tahar Djaout |publisher=French Publishers' Agency |url=http://www.frenchpubagency.com/?fuseaction=people.main&amp;pid=517 |accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Malek Bennabi]] and [[Frantz Fanon]] are noted for their thoughts on [[decolonization]]; [[Augustine of Hippo]] was born in [[Tagaste]] (modern-day [[Souk Ahras]]); and [[Ibn Khaldun]], though born in [[Tunis]], wrote the [[Muqaddima]] while staying in Algeria. The works of the [[Sanusi]] family in pre-colonial times, and of [[Emir Abdelkader]] and Sheikh [[Ben Badis]] in colonial times, are widely noted. The Latin author [[Apuleius]] was born in [[Madaurus]] (Mdaourouch), in what later became Algeria.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Contemporary [[Algerian cinema]] is various in terms of genre, exploring a wider range of themes and issues.

===Art===
[[File:Hamid Tibouchi, 1997.jpg|thumb|[[:fr:Hamid Tibouchi|Hamid Tibouchi]], a painter and calligrapher]]

Algerian painters, like [[:fr:Mohamed Racim|Mohamed Racim]] or Baya, attempted to revive the prestigious Algerian past prior to French colonization, at the same time that they have contributed to the preservation of the authentic values of Algeria. In this line, [[Mohamed Temam]], [[Abdelkhader Houamel]] have also returned through this art, scenes from the history of the country, the habits and customs of the past and the country life. Other new artistic currents including the one of [[M'hamed Issiakhem]], [[Mohammed Khadda]] and [[Bachir Yelles]], appeared on the scene of Algerian painting, abandoning figurative classical painting to find new pictorial ways, in order to adapt Algerian paintings to the new realities of the country through its struggle and its aspirations. [[Mohammed Khadda]]&lt;ref name=art&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khadda.com/ |title=Mohammed Khadda |publisher=Khadda.com |date= |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[M'hamed Issiakhem]] have been notable in recent years.&lt;ref name=art/&gt;

===Literature===
{{Main|Algerian literature|List of Algerian writers}}

The historic roots of Algerian literature goes back to the [[Numidia]]n era, when [[Apuleius]] wrote ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', the only Latin novel to survive in its entirety. This period had also known [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Nonius Marcellus]] and [[Martianus Capella]], among many others. The Middle Ages have known many Arabic writers who revolutionized the Arab world literature, with authors like [[Ahmad al-Buni]], [[Ibn Manzur]] and [[Ibn Khaldoun]], who wrote the [[Muqaddimah]] while staying in Algeria, and many others.

[[Albert Camus]] was an Algerian-born French Pied-Noir author. In 1957 he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in literature]].

{{double image|right|Lucius Apuleius Platonicus, from 'Crabbes Historical Dictionary', published in 1825 (C19).jpg|120|Kateb Yacine Nedjma authograph.jpg|120|[[Apuleius]]|[[Kateb Yacine]]}}

Today Algeria contains, in its literary landscape, big names having not only marked the Algerian literature, but also the universal literary heritage in Arabic and French.

As a first step, Algerian literature was marked by works whose main concern was the assertion of the Algerian national entity, there is the publication of novels as the ''Algerian trilogy'' of [[Mohammed Dib]], or even ''Nedjma'' of [[Kateb Yacine]] novel which is often regarded as a monumental and major work. Other known writers will contribute to the emergence of Algerian literature whom include [[Mouloud Feraoun]], [[Malek Bennabi]], [[Malek Haddad]], [[Moufdi Zakaria]], [[Ibn Badis]], Mohamed Laïd Al-Khalifa, [[Mouloud Mammeri]], [[Frantz Fanon]], and [[Assia Djebar]].

In the aftermath of the independence, several new authors emerged on the Algerian literary scene, they will attempt through their works to expose a number of social problems, among them there are [[Rachid Boudjedra]], [[Rachid Mimouni]], [[Leila Sebbar]], [[Tahar Djaout]] and [[Tahir Wattar]].

Currently, a part of Algerian writers tends to be defined in a literature of shocking expression, due to the terrorism that occurred during the 1990s, the other party is defined in a different style of literature who staged an individualistic conception of the human adventure. Among the most noted recent works, there is the writer, ''the swallows of Kabul'' and ''the attack'' of [[Yasmina Khadra]], ''the oath of barbarians'' of [[Boualem Sansal]], ''memory of the flesh'' of [[Ahlam Mosteghanemi]] and the last novel by Assia Djebar ''nowhere in my father's House''.

The Algerian state’s interest in film-industry activities can be seen in the annual budget of DZD 200 million (EUR 1.8) allocated to production, specific measures and an ambitious programme plan implemented by the Ministry of Culture in order to promote national production, renovate the cinema stock and remedy the weak links in distribution and exploitation.

The financial support provided by the state, through the Fund for the Development of the Arts, Techniques and the Film Industry (FDATIC) and the Algerian Agency for Cultural Influence (AARC), plays a key role in the promotion of national production. Between 2007 and 2013, FDATIC subsidised 98 films (feature films, documentaries and short films). In mid-2013, AARC had already supported a total of 78 films, including 42 feature films, 6 short films and 30 documentaries.

According to the European Audiovisual Observatory’s LUMIERE database, 41 Algerian films were distributed in Europe between 1996 and 2013. 21 films in this repertoire are Algerian-French co productions. Indigènes (Days of Glory) (2006) and Hors la loi (Outside the Law) (2010) by the director Rachid Bouchareb are two films in this repertoire that recorded the highest number of admissions in the European Union, with 3,172,612 admissions for Indigènes and 474,722 for Hors la loi.

[[File:Algérie - Arménie - 20140531 - Equipe d'Algérie.jpg|thumb|The Algeria national football team]]
Various games have existed in Algeria since antiquity. In the [[Aurès Mountains|Aures]], people played several games such As El Kherdba or El khergueba ([[chess]] variant). Playing cards, [[checkers]] and chess games are part of Algerian culture. Racing ([[Fantasia (culture)|fantasia]]) and the [[rifle shooting]] are part of cultural recreation of the Algerians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/15001/Algeria/220546/Sports-and-recreation | title=Sports and recreation | accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Algerian, Arab and African gold medalist is [[Boughera El Ouafi]] in [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Olympics of Amsterdam]] in the [[Marathon]]. The second Algerian Medalist was [[Alain Mimoun]] in [[1956 Summer Olympics]] in Melbourne. Several men and women were champions in athletics in the 1990s including [[Noureddine Morceli]], [[Hassiba Boulmerka]], [[Nouria Mérah-Benida|Nouria Merah-Benida]], and [[Taoufik Makhloufi]], all specialized in [[middle distance running]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/2012/countries/algeria/athletes | title=Algeria | accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Football in Algeria|Football]] is the most popular sport in Algeria. Several names are engraved in the history of the sport, including [[Lakhdar Belloumi]], [[Rachid Mekhloufi]], [[Hacène Lalmas|Hassen Lalmas]], [[Rabah Madjer]], [[Salah Assad]] and [[Djamel Zidane]]. The [[Algeria national football team]] qualified for the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]], [[1986 FIFA World Cup]], [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] and [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. In addition, several football clubs have won continental and international trophies as the club [[ES Sétif]] or [[JS Kabylia]]. The [[Algerian Football Federation]] is an association of Algeria football clubs organizing national competitions and international matches of the selection of Algeria national football team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/teams/algeria | title=Algeria national football team | accessdate=9 December 2012 | work=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Algerian cuisine}}
[[File:Bulgur wheat salad.jpg|thumb|A [[Couscous]] based Salad]]
Algerian cuisine is rich and diverse. The country was considered as the &quot;granary of Rome&quot;. It offers a component of dishes and varied dishes, depending on the region and according to the seasons. The cuisine uses cereals as the main products, since they are always produced with abundance in the country. There is not a dish where cereals are not present.

Algerian cuisine varies from one region to another, according to seasonal vegetables. It can be prepared using meat, fish and/or vegetables. Among the dishes known, [[couscous]],&lt;ref name=&quot;WDL&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8804/ |title = Luce Ben Aben, Moorish Women Preparing Couscous, Algiers, Algeria |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1899 |accessdate = 26 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[chorba]], the Rechta, the Chakhchoukha, the Berkoukes, the Shakshouka, the Mthewem, the Chtitha, the Mderbel, the Dolma, the Brik or Bourek, the Garantita, Lham'hlou, etc. [[Merguez]] sausage is very used in Algeria, but it differs, depending on the region and on the added spices.

The cakes are marketed and can be found in cities either in Algeria or in Europe or North America. However, traditional cakes made at home have a vast directory of revenue, according to the habits and customs of each family. Among these cakes, there are Tamina, Chrik, Garn logzelles, Griouech, Kalb el-louz, Makroud, Mbardja, Mchewek, Samsa, Tcharak, Baghrir, Khfaf, Zlabia, Aarayech, Ghroubiya, Mghergchette. The Algerian pastry also contains Tunisian or French cakes and it is marketed. The bread may be cooked such as Kessra or Khmira or Harchaya, chopsticks and so-called washers Khoubz dar or Matloue.
Other tradionel meals (Chakhchokha-Hassoua-T'chicha-Mahjouba and Doubara) are famous in Biskra.

==Health==
{{Main|Health in Algeria}}
In 2002, Algeria had inadequate numbers of physicians (1.13 per 1,000 people), nurses (2.23 per 1,000 people), and dentists (0.31 per 1,000 people). Access to &quot;improved water sources&quot; was limited to 92% of the population in urban areas and 80% of the population in rural areas. Some 99% of Algerians living in urban areas, but only 82% of those living in rural areas, had access to &quot;improved sanitation&quot;. According to the World Bank, Algeria is making progress toward its goal of &quot;reducing by half the number of people without sustainable access to improved drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015&quot;. Given Algeria's young population, policy favors preventive health care and clinics over hospitals. In keeping with this policy, the government maintains an immunization program. However, poor sanitation and unclean water still cause [[tuberculosis]], [[hepatitis]], [[measles]], [[typhoid fever]], [[cholera]] and [[dysentery]]. The poor generally receive health care free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Algeria.pdf |title=Library of Congress Country Studies – Algeria |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health records have been maintained in Algeria since 1882 and began adding Muslims living in the South to their Vital record database in 1905 during French rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kemp, Thomas Jay |title=International Vital Records Handbook|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=afnc6_o5AqoC&amp;pg=PA347|year=2009|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Com|isbn=978-0-8063-1793-9|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Algeria|List of universities in Algeria}}
[[File:Med Alger.jpg|thumb|[[Algiers]] Medical School]]

Since the 1970s, in a centralized system that was designed to significantly reduce the rate of illiteracy, the Algerian government introduced a decree by which the school became compulsory for all children aged between 6 and 15 years who have the ability to track their learning through the 20 facilities built since independence, now the literacy rate is around 78.7%.&lt;ref name=&quot;illit&quot;/&gt;

Since 1972, Arabic is used as the language of instruction during the first nine years of schooling. From the third year, French is taught and it is also the language of instruction for science classes. The students can also learn English, Italian, Spanish and German. In 2008, new programs at the elementary appeared, therefore the compulsory schooling does not start at the age of six anymore, but at the age of five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presse-dz.com/revue-de-presse/version-imprimable/1045-les-verites-de-benbouzid.html |title=Ecoles privées, Tamazight, enseignement du Français, syndicats&amp;nbsp;... – Les vérités de Benbouzid |publisher=Presse-dz.com |date= |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Apart from the 122 private, learning at school, the Universities of the State are free of charge. After nine years of primary school, students can go to the high school or to an educational institution. The school offers two programs: general or technical. At the end of the third year of secondary school, students pass the exam of the Bachelor's degree, which allows once it is successful to pursue graduate studies in universities and institutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.algerie-dz.com/article10808.html |title=Le taux d'analphabétisme en Algérie est de 21,3% |publisher=Algerie-dz.com |date= |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education is officially compulsory for children between the ages of six and 15. In 2008, the illiteracy rate for people over 10 was 22.3%, 15.6% for men and 29.0% for women. The province with the lowest rate of illiteracy was [[Algiers Province]] at 11.6%, while the province with the highest rate was [[Djelfa Province]] at 35.5%.&lt;ref name=&quot;illit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Taux d'Analphabétisme et taux d'Alphabétisation de la population âgée de 10 ans et plus selon le sexe et la wilaya de résidence|url=http://www.ons.dz/IMG/pdf/pop9_national.pdf|publisher=Office National des Statistiques}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algeria has 26 universities and 67 institutions of higher education, which must accommodate a million Algerians and 80,000 foreign students in 2008. The [[University of Algiers]], founded in 1879, is the oldest, it offers education in various disciplines (law, medicine, science and letters). 25 of these universities and almost all of the institutions of higher education were founded after the independence of the country.

Even if some of them offer instruction in [[Arabic]] like areas of law and the economy, most of the other sectors as science and medicine continue to be provided in French and English. Among the most important universities, there are the [[University of Sciences and Technology Houari Boumediene]], the [[University of Mentouri]] Constantine, [[University of Oran]] Es-Senia. Best universities of qualifications remain the [[University of Abou Bekr Belkaïd]] in Tlemcen and [[University of Batna]] Hadj Lakhdar, they occupy the 26th and 45th row in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webometrics.info/en/Africa/Algeria |title=Algeria &amp;#124; Ranking Web of Universities |publisher=Webometrics.info |date= |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that [[Newtonian mechanics]] was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of [[classical mechanics]] with the laws of the [[electromagnetic field]]. This led to the development of his [[special theory of relativity]]. He realized, however, that the principle of relativity could also be extended to [[gravitational fields]], and with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916, he published a paper on the general theory of relativity. He continued to deal with problems of [[statistical mechanics]] and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of [[particle|particle theory]] and the [[Brownian motion|motion of molecules]]. He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the [[photon]] theory of light. In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to model the large-scale structure of the [[universe]].<ref name=Nobel>[http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2011/advanced-physicsprize2011.pdf "Scientific Background on the Nobel Prize in Physics 2011.

He was visiting the United States when [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933 and, being Jewish, did not go back to Germany, where he had been a professor at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]]. He settled in the U.S., becoming an [[Citizenship in the United States|American citizen]] in 1940.<ref name="misc">{{cite web |url=http://www.einstein-website.de/z_information/variousthings.html |title=Various things about Albert Einstein |last=Hans-Josef |first=Küpper |year=2000 |publisher=einstein-website.de |accessdate=18 July 2009}}</ref> On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a [[Einstein–Szilárd letter|letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] alerting him to the potential development of "extremely powerful bombs of a new type" and recommending that the U.S. begin similar research. This eventually led to what would become the [[Manhattan Project]]. Einstein supported defending the Allied forces, but largely denounced the idea of using the newly discovered [[nuclear fission]] as a weapon. Later, with the British philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], Einstein signed the [[Russell–Einstein Manifesto]], which highlighted the danger of nuclear weapons. Einstein was affiliated with the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], until his death in 1955.

The Einsteins were non-observant [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. Albert attended a [[Catholic school|Catholic elementary school]] from the age of 5 for three years.

In 1894, his father's company failed: direct current (DC) lost the [[War of Currents]] to [[alternating current]] (AC). In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to [[Milan]] and then, a few months later, to [[Pavia]]. When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue [[electrical engineering]], but Einstein clashed with authorities and resented the school's regimen and teaching method. He later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought were lost in strict [[rote learning]]. At the end of December 1894, he travelled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor's note.<ref>A.

In 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein sat the entrance examinations for the [[ETH|Swiss Federal Polytechnic]] in [[Zürich]] (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule ETH). He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination,<ref>Einstein ''Collected Papers'', Vol. 1 (1987, eds. J.

Marie Winteler moved to [[Olsberg, Aargau|Olsberg]], Switzerland for a teaching post.

Einstein's future wife, [[Mileva Marić]], also enrolled at the Polytechnic that same year, the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course. Over the next few years, Einstein and Marić's friendship developed into romance, and they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which Einstein was taking an increasing interest. In 1900, Einstein was awarded the Zürich Polytechnic teaching diploma, but Marić failed the examination with a poor grade in the mathematics component, theory of functions.<ref>''Albert Einstein Collected Papers'', vol. 1, 1987, doc. 67.</ref> There have been claims that Marić collaborated with Einstein on his celebrated 1905 papers,<ref>Troemel-Ploetz, D., "Mileva Einstein-Marić: The Woman Who Did Einstein's Mathematics", ''Women's Studies Int.

With the discovery and publication in 1987 of an early correspondence between Einstein and Marić it became known that they had a daughter they called [[Lieserl Einstein|"Lieserl"]] in their letters, born in early 1902 in [[Novi Sad]] where Marić was staying with her parents. Marić returned to Switzerland without the child, whose real name and fate are unknown. Einstein probably never saw his daughter, and the contents of a letter he wrote to Marić in September 1903 suggest that she was either adopted or died of [[scarlet fever]] in infancy.<ref>J.

Einstein and Marić married in January 1903. In May 1904, the couple's first son, [[Hans Albert Einstein]], was born in [[Bern]], [[Switzerland]]. Their second son, [[Eduard Einstein|Eduard]], was born in Zurich in July 1910. In 1914, Einstein moved to [[Berlin]], while his wife remained in [[Zurich]] with their sons. They divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years.

Einstein [[cousin marriage|married]] [[Elsa Einstein|Elsa Löwenthal]] on 2 June 1919, after having had a relationship with her since 1912. She was his first cousin maternally and his second cousin paternally. In 1933, they emigrated to the United States. In 1935, Elsa Einstein was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems and died in December 1936.<ref name="Highfield216">{{Harvnb|Highfield|Carter|1993|p=216}}</ref>

Much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electrical-mechanical synchronization of time, two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the [[thought experiment]]s that eventually led Einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time.<ref>Peter Galison, "Einstein's Clocks: The Question of Time" ''Critical Inquiry'' 26, no. 2 (Winter 2000).</ref>

With a few friends he had met in Bern, Einstein started a small discussion group, self-mockingly named "[[Olympia Academy|The Olympia Academy]]", which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy. Their readings included the works of [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Ernst Mach]], and [[David Hume]], which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook.

===Academic career===
[[File:Albert Einstein (Nobel).png|thumb|upright|Einstein's official 1921 portrait after receiving the Nobel Prize in Physics]]
In 1900, his paper [[List of scientific publications by Albert Einstein#Journal articles|"Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen"]] ("Conclusions from the Capillarity Phenomena") was published in the prestigious ''[[Annalen der Physik]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Einstein |first=Albert |url=http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/einstein-papers/1901_4_513-523.pdf |journal=Annalen der Physik |title=Folgerungen aus den Capillaritatserscheinungen |trans_title=Conclusions from the Capillarity Phenomena |language=German |volume=309 |issue=3 |pages=513–523 |date=13 December 1900 |location=Zürich, Switzerland |format=PDF |doi=10.1002/andp.19013090306 |bibcode = 1901AnP...309..513E |accessdate=18 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Galison |first=Peter | authorlink=Peter Galison |title=Einstein's Clocks, Poincaré's Maps: Empires of Time |publisher=W.W.

By 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the [[University of Bern]]. The following year, after giving a lecture on [[electrodynamics]] and the relativity principle at the University of Zurich, [[Alfred Kleiner]] recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics. Einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.library.ethz.ch/en/Resources/Digital-library/Einstein-Online/Associate-Professor-at-the-Universiy-of-Zurich-und-professor-in-Prague-1909-1912 |title=Associate Professor at the Universiy of Zurich und professor in Prague (1909–1912) |publisher=ETH-Bibliothek Zurich, ETH Zürich, http://www.ethz.ch |location=Bern, Switzerland |series=Einstein Online |website=http://www.library.ethz.ch/en/Resources/Digital-library/Einstein-Online |year=2014 |type=digital library |language=German and English |accessdate=17 August 2014}}</ref>

Einstein became a full professor at [[Charles-Ferdinand University]] in Prague in 1911, but returned to his alma mater in [[Zurich]] in 1912. From 1912 until 1914 he was professor of theoretical physics at the [[ETH Zurich|ETH]] in Zurich, where he taught analytical mechanics and [[thermodynamics]]. He also studied continuum mechanics, the molecular theory of heat, and the problem of gravitation, on which he worked with mathematician [[Marcel Grossmann]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.library.ethz.ch/en/Resources/Digital-library/Einstein-Online/Professor-at-the-ETH-Zurich-1912-1914 |title=Professor at the ETH Zurich (1912–1914) |publisher=ETH-Bibliothek Zurich, ETH Zürich, http://www.ethz.ch |location=Zurich, Switzerland |series=Einstein Online |website=http://www.library.ethz.ch/en/Resources/Digital-library/Einstein-Online |year=2014 |type=digital library |language=German and English |accessdate=17 August 2014}}</ref>

Based on calculations Einstein made in 1911, about his new theory of general relativity, light from another star would be bent by the Sun's gravity. In 1919 that prediction was confirmed by Sir [[Arthur Stanley Eddington|Arthur Eddington]] during the [[solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]]. Those observations were published in the international media, making Einstein world famous. On 7 November 1919, the leading British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' printed a banner headline that read: "Revolution in Science&nbsp;– New Theory of the Universe&nbsp;– Newtonian Ideas Overthrown".<ref name="Eddington">{{cite journal |last=Andrzej |first=Stasiak |year=2003 |title=Myths in science |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=4 |issue=3 |page=236 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.embor779 |url=http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v4/n3/full/embor779.html |accessdate =31 March 2007}}</ref>

In 1921, Einstein was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]  for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, as relativity was considered still somewhat controversial. He also received the [[Copley Medal]] from the [[Royal Society]] in 1925.<ref name="frs"/>

===Travels abroad, 1921–1922===
[[File:Einstein in NY 1921.jpg|thumb|240px|Einstein in New York, 1921, his first visit to the United States]]
Einstein visited New York City for the first time on 2 April 1921, where he received an official welcome by Mayor [[John Francis Hylan]], followed by three weeks of lectures and receptions. He went on to deliver several lectures at [[Columbia University]] and [[Princeton University]], and in Washington he accompanied representatives of the [[National Academy of Science]] on a visit to the [[White House]]. On his return to Europe he was the guest of the British statesman and philosopher [[Viscount Haldane]] in London, where he met several renowned scientific, intellectual and political figures, and delivered a lecture at [[King's College London|King's College]].<ref>Hoffman and Dukas (1972), pp. 145–148; Fölsing (1997), pp. 499–508.</ref>

He also published an essay, "My First Impression of the U.S.A.," in July 1921, in which he tried briefly to describe some characteristics of Americans, much as [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] did, who published his own impressions in ''[[Democracy in America]]'' (1835).<ref>[http://www.einsteinsworld.com/News-New-York-Herald-Tribune-1931-As-Einstein-Sees-America.htm "As Einstein Sees American"], ''Einstein's World'', a 1931 reprint with minor changes, of his 1921 essay.</ref> For some of his observations, Einstein was clearly surprised: "What strikes a visitor is the joyous, positive attitude to life . . . The American is friendly, self-confident, optimistic, and without envy."<ref name=Holton/>{{rp|20}}

In 1922, his travels took him to Asia and later to Palestine, as part of a six-month excursion and speaking tour, as he visited  [[Singapore]], [[Ceylon]] and [[Japan]],  where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of Japanese. After his first public lecture, he met the emperor and empress at the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Imperial Palace]], where thousands came to watch. In a letter to his sons, Einstein described his impression of the Japanese as being modest, intelligent, considerate, and having a true feel for art.<ref name=Isaacson2/>{{rp|307}}<ref name=Isaacson2>Isaacson, Walter. ''Einstein: His Life and Universe'', Simon & Schuster (2007)</ref>{{rp|308}}

On his return voyage, he visited [[British Mandate for Palestine|Palestine]] for 12 days in what would become his only visit to that region. Einstein was greeted as if he were a head of state, rather than a physicist, which included a cannon salute upon arriving at the home of the British high commissioner, [[Sir Herbert Samuel]]. During one reception, the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him. In Einstein's talk to the audience, he expressed happiness that the Jewish people were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world.<ref name=Isaacson/>{{rp|308}}

===Travel to U.S., 1930–1931===
In December 1930, Einstein visited America for the second time, originally intended as a two-month working visit as a research fellow at the [[California Institute of Technology]]. After the national attention he received during his first trip to the U.S., he and his arrangers aimed to protect his privacy. Although swamped with telegrams and invitations to receive awards or speak publicly, he declined them all.<ref name=Isaacson/>{{rp|368}}

[[File:Albert Einstein and Charlie Chaplin - 1931.jpg|thumb|left|[[Charlie Chaplin]] and Einstein at the Hollywood premier of ''[[City Lights]]'', January 1931]]
After arriving in New York City, Einstein was taken to various places and events, including [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]], a lunch with the editors of the ''New York Times'', and a performance of ''Carmen'' at the [[Metropolitan Opera]], where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival. During the days following, he was given the keys to the city by Mayor [[Jimmy Walker]] and met the president of [[Columbia University]], who described Einstein as "the ruling monarch of the mind."<ref name=Isaacson/>{{rp|370}} [[Harry Emerson Fosdick]], pastor at New York's [[Riverside Church]], gave Einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full-size statue the church made of Einstein, standing at the entrance.<ref name=Isaacson/>{{rp|370}} Also during his stay in New York, he joined a crowd of 15,000 people at [[Madison Square Garden]] during a [[Hanukkah]] celebration.<ref name=Isaacson/>{{rp|370}}

Einstein next traveled to California where he met [[Caltech]] president and Nobel laureate, [[Robert A. Millikan]]. His friendship with Millikan was "awkward", as Millikan "had a penchant for patriotic militarism," where Einstein was a pronounced pacifist.<ref name=Isaacson/>{{rp|373}} During an address to Caltech's students, Einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good.<ref name=Isaacson/>{{rp|374}}

This aversion to war also led Einstein to befriend author [[Upton Sinclair]] and film star [[Charlie Chaplin]], both noted for their pacifism. [[Carl Laemmle]], head of [[Universal Studios]], gave Einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to Chaplin. They had an instant rapport, with Chaplin inviting Einstein and his wife, Elsa, to his home for dinner. Chaplin said Einstein's outward persona, calm and gentle, seemed to conceal a "highly emotional temperament," from which came his "extraordinary intellectual energy."<ref name=Chaplin>Chaplin, Charles. ''Charles Chaplin: My Autobiography'', Simon and Schuster, N.Y. (1964)</ref>{{rp|320}}

Chaplin also remembers Elsa telling him about the time Einstein conceived his [[theory of relativity]]. During breakfast one morning, he seemed lost in thought and ignored his food. She asked him if something was bothering him. He sat down at his piano and started playing. He continued playing and writing notes for half an hour, then went upstairs to his study, where he remained for two weeks, with Elsa bringing up his food. At the end of the two weeks he came downstairs with two sheets of paper bearing his theory.<ref name=Chaplin/>{{rp|320}}

Chaplin's film, ''[[City Lights]]'', was to premier a few days later in Hollywood, and Chaplin invited Einstein and Elsa to join him as his special guests, described by Isaacson as "one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity." Einstein and Chaplin arrived together, in black tie, with Elsa joining them, "beaming." The audience applauded as they entered the theater.<ref name=Isaacson/>{{rp|374}} Chaplin visited Einstein at his home on a later trip to Berlin, and recalled his "modest little flat" and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory. Chaplin speculated that it was "possibly used as kindling wood by the Nazis."<ref name=Chaplin/>{{rp|322}}

===Emigration to U.S. in 1933===

In February 1933 while on a visit to the United States, Einstein knew he could not to return to Germany with the rise to power of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] under Germany's new chancellor, Adolf Hitler.<ref>Fölsing (1997), p. 659.</ref><ref>Isaacson (2007), p. 404.</ref>

While at American universities in early 1933, he undertook his third two-month visiting professorship at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in Pasadena. He and his wife Elsa returned to Belgium by ship in March, and during the trip they learned that their cottage was raided by the Nazis and his personal sailboat confiscated. Upon landing in [[Antwerp]] on 28 March, he immediately went to the German consulate and turned in his passport, formally renouncing his German citizenship.<ref name=Isaacson/> A few years later, the Nazis sold his boat and turned his cottage into an Aryan youth camp.<ref>{{YouTube|id=HZ_W3EAfp6I#t=20m50s|title="Albert Einstein: How I See the World"}}, ''PBS''</ref>

====Refugee status====
In April 1933, he also discovered that the new German government had passed laws barring Jews from holding any official positions, including teaching at universities.<ref name=Isaacson/> Historian [[Gerald Holton]] describes how, with "virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues," thousands of Jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed.<ref name=Holton>Holton, Gerald.

A month later, Einstein's works were among those targeted by [[Nazi book burnings]], with Nazi propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] proclaiming, "Jewish intellectualism is dead."<ref name=Isaacson>Isaacson, Walter. ''Einstein: His Life and Universe'', Simon & Schuster (2007) pp. 407–410</ref> One German magazine included him in a list of enemies of the German regime with the phrase, "not yet hanged", offering a $5,000 bounty on his head.<ref name=Isaacson/><ref name=Jerome>Jerome, Fred, and Taylor, Rodger.

[[File:Einstein and Locker-Lampson.jpeg|thumb|Einstein surrounded by Oliver Locker-Lampson (seated) and assistants assigned to protect him]]
Einstein was now without a permanent home, unsure where he would live and work, and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in Germany. He rented a house in Belgium where he lived for a few months. In late July 1933, he went to England for about six weeks at the personal invitation of British naval officer Commander [[Oliver Locker-Lampson]], who had become friends with Einstein in the preceding years. To protect Einstein, Locker-Lampson secretly had two assistants watch over him at his secluded cottage outside of London, with the press publishing a photo of them guarding Einstein.<ref name=Isaacson/>{{rp|422}}

Locker-Lampson took Einstein to meet [[Winston Churchill]] at his home, and later, [[Austen Chamberlain]] and former Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]].<ref name=Isaacson/>{{rp|419–420}} Einstein asked them to help bring Jewish scientists out of Germany. British historian [[Martin Gilbert]] notes that Churchill responded immediately, and sent his friend, physicist [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Frederick Lindemann]] to Germany to seek out Jewish scientists and place them in British universities.<ref name=Gilbert>Gilbert, Martin. ''Churchill and the Jews'', Henry Holt and Company, N.Y. (2007) pp. 101, 176</ref> Churchill later observed that as a result of Germany having driven the Jews out, they lowered their "technical standards," and had put [[Allies of World War II|the Allies']] technology ahead of theirs.<ref name=Gilbert/>

Einstein later contacted leaders of other nations, including [[Turkey]]'s Prime Minister, [[İsmet İnönü]], who he wrote in September 1933 requesting placement of unemployed German-Jewish scientists. As a result of Einstein's letter, Jewish invitees to Turkey eventually totaled over "1,000 saved individuals."<ref>Reisman, Arnold. [http://hnn.us/article/31946 "What a Freshly Discovered Einstein Letter Says About Turkey Today"], ''History News Network,'', George Masons University, Nov. 20, 2006</ref>

Locker-Lampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend British citizenship to Einstein, during which period Einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in Europe. The bill failed to become law, however, and Einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the Princeton [[Institute for Advanced Study]], in the U.S., to become a resident scholar.<ref name="Clark 1971">{{Citation |last = Clark |first = Ronald W. |author-link = Ronald W.

====Resident scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study====
[[File:Einstein-formal portrait-35.jpg|thumb|Portrait taken in 1935 in Princeton]]
In October 1933 Einstein returned to the U.S. and took up a position at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] (in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], New Jersey),<ref name="Clark 1971" /><ref>Fölsing (1997), pp. 649, 678.</ref> noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany.<ref name="Arntzenius2011"/> At the time, most American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students, as a result of their [[Jewish quota]] which lasted until the late 1940s.<ref name="Arntzenius2011">{{cite book|author=Linda G. Arntzenius|title=Institute for Advanced Study|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zHHguITir80C&pg=PA19|year=2011|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-7409-7|page=19}}</ref>

He was still undecided on his future (he had offers from European universities, including [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]), but in 1935 he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the [[United States]] and apply for citizenship.<ref name="Clark 1971" /><ref>Fölsing (1997), pp.&nbsp;686–687.</ref>

Einstein's affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study would last until his death in 1955.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ias.edu/people/einstein/in-brief |title=In Brief |publisher=Institute for Advanced Study |accessdate=4 March 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100329064405/http://www.ias.edu/people/einstein/in-brief| archivedate= 29 March 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
He was one of the four first selected (two of the others being [[John von Neumann]] and [[Kurt Gödel]]) at the new Institute, where he soon developed a close friendship with Gödel. The two would take long walks together discussing their work. [[Bruria Kaufman]], his assistant, later became a physicist.  During this period, Einstein tried to develop a [[unified field theory]] and to refute the [[Copenhagen interpretation|accepted interpretation]] of [[quantum physics]], both unsuccessfully.

Other scientists also fled to America, including Nobel laureates and professors of [[theoretical physics]]. With so many other Jewish scientists now forced by circumstances to live in America, often working side by side, Einstein wrote. "In my whole life I have never felt so Jewish as now."<ref name=Isaacson/>

====World War II and the Manhattan Project====
In 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist [[Leó Szilárd]] attempted to alert Washington of ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research. The group's warnings were discounted.<ref name=Pritchard>{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/7970619/Obama-could-kill-fossil-fuels-overnight-with-a-nuclear-dash-for-thorium.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Obama could kill fossil fuels overnight with a nuclear dash for thorium | first=Ambrose | last=Evans-Pritchard | date=29 August 2010}}</ref> Einstein and Szilárd, along with other refugees such as [[Edward Teller]] and [[Eugene Wigner]], "regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the [[German nuclear energy project|race to build an atomic bomb]], and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon."<ref name=Isaacson2/>{{rp|630}}<ref name=Gosling>Gosling, F.G.

Roosevelt]] to alert him of the possibility. The letter also recommended that the U.S. government pay attention to and become directly involved in uranium research and associated chain reaction research.

The letter is believed to be "arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II".<ref>Diehl, Sarah J.; Moltz, James Clay.

As a result of Einstein's letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the U.S. entered the "race" to develop the bomb, drawing on its "immense material, financial, and scientific resources" to initiate the [[Manhattan Project]]. It became the only country to successfully develop an atomic bomb during World War II.

For Einstein, "war was a disease&nbsp;... [and] he called for resistance to war." By signing the letter to Roosevelt he went against his pacifist principles.<ref>{{cite web|author=Einstein, Albert|year=1952|title=On My Participation in the Atom Bomb Project|url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/Docs/Hiroshima/EinsteinResponse.shtml}}</ref> In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, [[Linus Pauling]], "I made one great mistake in my life—when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification—the danger that the Germans would make them&nbsp;..."<ref name="regret">''Einstein: The Life and Times'' by Ronald Clark. page 752</ref>

====US citizenship====
[[File:Citizen-Einstein.jpg|thumb|Einstein accepting [[Citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizenship]] certificate from judge [[Phillip Forman]]]]
Einstein became an American citizen in 1940. Not long after settling into his career at the Institute for Advanced Study (in Princeton, New Jersey), he expressed his appreciation of the [[meritocracy]] in American culture when compared to Europe. He recognized the "right of individuals to say and think what they pleased", without social barriers, and as a result, individuals were encouraged, he said, to be more creative, a trait he valued from his own early education.<ref name=Isaacson/>{{rp|432}}

===Personal life===

====Supporter of civil rights====
Einstein was a passionate, committed antiracist and joined [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in Princeton, where he campaigned for the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1896–1954)|civil rights]] of African Americans. He considered racism America's "worst disease,"<ref name="Jerome"/> seeing it as "handed down from one generation to the next."<ref>Calaprice, Alice (2005) ''[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7921.html The new quotable Einstein]''. pp.148–149 Princeton University Press, 2005.

[[File:Albert Einstein Head.jpg|thumb|Einstein in 1947]]
In 1946 Einstein visited [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]] in Pennsylvania where he was awarded an honorary degree. Lincoln was the first university to grant college degrees to blacks, including [[Langston Hughes]] and [[Thurgood Marshall]]. To its students, Einstein gave a speech about racism in America, adding, "I do not intend to be quiet about it."<ref name=civil>[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2007/04/albert-einstein-civil-rights-activist/ "Albert Einstein, Civil Rights activist"], ''Harvard Gazette'', April 12, 2007</ref> A resident of Princeton recalls that Einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student,<ref name=civil/> and black physicist [[Sylvester James Gates]] states that Einstein had been one of his early science heroes, later finding out about Einstein's support for civil rights.<ref name=civil/>

====Assisting Zionist causes====
Einstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], which opened in 1925, and was among its first Board of Governors. Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the [[World Zionist Organization]], [[Chaim Weizmann]], to help raise funds for the planned university.<ref name=Isaacson/>{{rp|290}} He also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs.

Among those, he advised first creating an Institute of Agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land. That should be followed, he suggested, by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology, to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as [[malaria]], which he called an "evil" that was undermining a third of the country's development.<ref name=Rowe/>{{rp|161}} Establishing an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic, for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments, was also important.<ref name=Rowe>Rowe, David E. and Schulmann, Robert, editors.

Chaim Weizmann later became Israel's first president.

====Love of music====
{{quote box|width = 300px|quote=If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music...

Einstein developed an appreciation of music at an early age. His mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the [[violin]], not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into [[German Culture|German culture]]. According to conductor [[Leon Botstein]], Einstein is said to have begun playing when he was 5, although he did not enjoy it at that age.<ref name=Botstein/>

{{Multiple image|direction = vertical|image1 = Albert Einstein violin.jpg|image2 = Rabindranath with Einstein.jpg|caption1 = Albert Einstein playing [[violin]]|caption2 = Einstein with musician and Nobel laureate [[Rabindranath Tagore]], 1930|align = right}}

When he turned 13 he discovered the violin sonatas of [[Mozart]], whereupon "Einstein fell in love" with Mozart's music and studied music more willingly.  He taught himself to play without "ever practicing systematically", he said, deciding that "love is a better teacher than a sense of duty."<ref name=Botstein>Botstein, Leon; Galison, Peter; Holton, Gerald James; Schweber, Silvan S. ''Einstein for the 21st century: His Legacy in Science, Art, and Modern Culture'', Princeton Univ. Press (2008) pp.&nbsp;161–164</ref> At age 17, he was heard by a school examiner in Aarau as he played [[Beethoven]]'s [[violin sonata]]s, the examiner stating afterward that his playing was "remarkable and revealing of 'great insight'." What struck the examiner, writes Botstein, was that Einstein "displayed a deep love of the music, a quality that was and remains in short supply. Music possessed an unusual meaning for this student."<ref name=Botstein/>

Music took on a pivotal and permanent role in Einstein's life from that period on. Although the idea of becoming a professional himself was not on his mind at any time, among those with whom Einstein played [[chamber music]] were a few professionals, and he performed for private audiences and friends. Chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in Bern, Zürich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others.

In 1931, while engaged in research at the California Institute of Technology, he visited the Zoellner family conservatory in Los Angeles, where he played some of Beethoven and Mozart's works with members of the [[Zoellner Quartet]].<ref name=Times>[http://articles.latimes.com/1985-12-22/entertainment/ca-20526_1_life-estate Cariaga, Daniel, "Not Taking It with You: A Tale of Two Estates," ''Los Angeles Times''], 22 December 1985.

Einstein's views about religious belief have been collected from interviews and original writings.

"It seems to me that the idea of a personal God is an anthropological concept which I cannot take seriously. I feel also not able to imagine some will or goal outside the human sphere. My views are near those of Spinoza: admiration for the beauty of and belief in the logical simplicity of the order which we can grasp humbly and only imperfectly."</ref>  Einstein once wrote: I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but expressed it clearly.<ref>{{cite book | author=Banesh Hoffman, Helen Dukas  | year=1981 | title=Albert Einstein: The Human Side | publisher=Princeton University Press | isbn=0691023689 }}, p. 178</ref>

The ''Annus Mirabilis'' papers are four articles pertaining to the [[photoelectric effect]] (which gave rise to [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]]), [[Brownian motion]], the [[special theory of relativity]], and [[Mass–energy equivalence|E = mc<sup>2</sup>]] that Albert Einstein published in the ''Annalen der Physik'' scientific journal in 1905. These four works contributed substantially to the foundation of [[History of physics#Modern physics|modern physics]] and changed views on [[space]], time, and [[matter]]. The four papers are:

===Thermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physics===
{{Main|Statistical mechanics|thermal fluctuations|statistical physics}}

Albert Einstein's first paper<ref name=PubList>{{cite web|author=Hans-Josef Kuepper |url=http://www.einstein-website.de/z_physics/wisspub-e.html |title=List of Scientific Publications of Albert Einstein |publisher=Einstein-website.de |accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref> submitted in 1900 to ''Annalen der Physik'' was on [[capillary attraction]]. It was published in 1901 with the title "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen", which translates as "Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena". Two papers he published in 1902–1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret [[atom]]ic phenomena from a statistical point of view. These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist. His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.<ref name=PubList/>

===General principles===
He articulated the [[principle of relativity]]. This was understood by [[Hermann Minkowski]] to be a generalization of rotational invariance from space to space-time. Other principles postulated by Einstein and later vindicated are the [[principle of equivalence]] and the principle of [[adiabatic invariant|adiabatic invariance]] of the quantum number.

===Theory of relativity and ''E'' = ''mc''²===
{{Main|History of special relativity}}
Einstein's "''Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper''" ("On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies") was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year. It reconciles [[Maxwell's equations]] for electricity and magnetism with the laws of mechanics, by introducing major changes to mechanics close to the [[speed of light]]. This later became known as Einstein's [[special theory of relativity]].

Consequences of this include the [[Spacetime|time-space frame]] of a moving body appearing to [[Time dilation|slow down]] and [[Length contraction|contract]] (in the direction of motion) when measured in the frame of the observer. This paper also argued that the idea of a [[luminiferous aether]]—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time—was superfluous.<ref>{{harv|Einstein|1905d}}</ref>

In his paper on [[mass–energy equivalence]], Einstein produced ''E''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''mc''<sup>2</sup> from his special relativity equations.<ref name=Stachel>{{cite book| last=Stachel| first=John J.| title=Einstein from "B" to "Z"| publisher=Springer-Verlag New York, LLC| series=Einstein Studies, Vol. 9| date=December 2001| location=Center for Einstein Studies, Boston University| pages=vi, 15, 90, 131, 215| url=http://books.google.com/?id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC&pg=PA215&dq=mass%E2%80%93energy+equivalence#| isbn=978-0-8176-4143-6}}</ref> Einstein's 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with [[Max Planck]].<ref>For a discussion of the reception of relativity theory around the world, and the different controversies it encountered, see the articles in Thomas F.

===Photons and energy quanta===
[[Image:Photoelectric effect.svg|thumb|upright|The photoelectric effect. Incoming photons on the left strike a metal plate (bottom), and eject electrons, depicted as flying off to the right.]]
{{Main|Photon|Quantum}}
In a 1905 paper,<ref>{{Citation | last = Einstein | first = Albert | title = Über einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt | journal=Annalen der Physik | volume = 17 | pages = 132–148 | year = 1905 | url = http://www.zbp.univie.ac.at/dokumente/einstein1.pdf | accessdate =27 June 2009 |bibcode = 1905AnP...322..132E |doi = 10.1002/andp.19053220607 | issue = 6 }}</ref> Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (''[[quantum|quanta]]''). Einstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with [[Robert Millikan]]'s detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of [[Compton scattering]].

Einstein concluded that each wave of frequency ''f'' is associated with a collection of [[photon]]s with energy ''hf'' each, where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]]. He does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave. But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.<ref>{{harv|Einstein|1905a}}.</ref>

===Quantized atomic vibrations===
{{Main|Einstein solid}}
In 1907, Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be different, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. [[Peter Debye]] refined this model.<ref>[http://www.osti.gov/accomplishments/nuggets/einstein/solidcolda.html Celebrating Einstein "Solid Cold". U.S. DOE.], [[Office of Scientific and Technical Information]], 2011.</ref>

===Adiabatic principle and action-angle variables===
{{Main|Old quantum theory}}
Throughout the 1910s, quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems. After [[Ernest Rutherford]] discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the [[periodic table of the elements]].

Einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments [[Wilhelm Wien]] had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of [[adiabatic invariant|adiabatic invariance]] of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the [[blackbody radiation|blackbody curves]] at different temperature to be derived from one another by a [[Wien's displacement law|simple shifting process]]. Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] identified this adiabatic invariant as the [[action-angle variables|action variable]] of classical mechanics.

===Wave–particle duality===
[[File:Albert Einstein photo 1921.jpg|thumb|upright|Einstein during his visit to the United States]]
{{Main|Wave–particle duality}}
Although the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia. In 1908, he became a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' at the University of Bern.<ref>{{Citation|last = Pais |first = Abraham |author-link = Abraham Pais |year = 1982 |title = Subtle is the Lord. The Science and the Life of Albert Einstein |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn = 0-19-853907-X |page = 522 }}</ref>
In "''über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung''" ("[[s:The Development of Our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation|The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation]]"), on the [[quantization (physics)|quantization]] of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's energy quanta must have well-defined [[momentum|momenta]] and act in some respects as independent, [[point particle|point-like particles]]. This paper introduced the ''photon'' concept (although the name ''photon'' was introduced later by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] in 1926) and inspired the notion of [[wave–particle duality]] in [[quantum mechanics]]. Einstein saw this wave-particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation.

===Theory of critical opalescence===
{{Main|Critical opalescence}}
Einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to [[Rayleigh scattering]], which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue.<ref name="Levenson">Levenson, Thomas. "[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/einstein/genius/ Einstein's Big Idea]". ''[[Public Broadcasting Service]].'' 2005. Retrieved on 25 February 2006.</ref> Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.

===Zero-point energy===
{{Main|Zero-point energy}}
Einstein's physical intuition led him to note that Planck's oscillator energies had an incorrect zero point. He modified Planck's hypothesis by stating that the lowest energy state of an oscillator is equal to {{frac|1|2}}''hf'', to half the energy spacing between levels. This argument, which was made in 1913 in collaboration with [[Otto Stern]], was based on the thermodynamics of a diatomic molecule which can split apart into two free atoms.

===General relativity and the equivalence principle===
{{Main|History of general relativity}}
{{See also|Principle of equivalence|Theory of relativity|Einstein field equations}}
[[Image:1919 eclipse positive.jpg|alt=Black circle covering the sun, rays visible around it, in a dark sky.|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Stanley Eddington|Eddington]]'s photograph of a [[solar eclipse]]]]
General relativity (GR) is a [[theory of gravitation]] that was developed by Albert Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to [[general relativity]], the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of [[spacetime|space and time]] by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern [[astrophysics]]. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of [[black holes]], regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.

As Albert Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within [[special relativity]] was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory.<ref>Albert Einstein, [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/einstein-lecture.html Nobel lecture] in 1921</ref> Consequently, in 1908 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity. In that article, he argued that [[free fall]] is really inertial motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is called the [[equivalence principle]]. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomenon of [[gravitational time dilation]]. In 1911, Einstein published another article expanding on the 1907 article, in which additional effects such as the [[Gravitational lensing|deflection of light]] by massive bodies were predicted.

===Hole argument and Entwurf theory===
{{Main|Hole argument}}
While developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the [[gauge invariance]] in the theory. He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations, and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.

In June 1913, the Entwurf ("draft") theory was the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. Simultaneously less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, after more than two years of intensive work Einstein abandoned the theory in November 1915 after realizing that the [[hole argument]] was mistaken.<ref>van Dongen, Jeroen (2010) ''Einstein's Unification'' Cambridge University Press, p.23.</ref>

===Cosmology===
{{Main|Cosmology}}
In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe as a whole. He apprehended that his equations predicted the universe to be either contracting or expanding. He wanted the universe to be eternal and unchanging, but this type of universe is not consistent with relativity. To fix this, Einstein modified the general theory by introducing a new notion, the [[cosmological constant]], which he called <nowiki>''Lambda''</nowiki>.<ref>[http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/outthere/2014/03/14/135th-birthday-einstein-still-full-surprises/#.UybABMHiG9V On 135th Birthday, Einstein still full of surprises, Discover Magazine Blog, Retrieved 14 March 2014]</ref> The purpose of Lambda was to rectify the effects of gravity and allow the whole system to stay balanced. With a positive cosmological constant, the universe could be an eternal static sphere. However, in 1929, [[Edwin Hubble]] confirmed that the universe is expanding, Einstein exclaimed after his [[Mount Wilson Observatory|Mount Wilson]] visit with Hubble: "If there is no quasi-static world, then away with the cosmological term!"<ref>[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=qLxUGXO2SVIC&pg=PA166&lpg=PA166&dq=If+there+is+no+quasi-static+world,+then+away+with+the+cosmological+term!&source=bl&ots=y9koDPlsYg&sig=X5rMLRKiiGdK5cAjoO0T9gOpwe4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=psEmU4S4FMiPrgfQhoDQCQ&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=If%20there%20is%20no%20quasi-static%20world%2C%20then%20away%20with%20the%20cosmological%20term!&f=false Quote Reference for Cosmo-Constant, Google Books Archive]</ref><ref>[http://www.sps.ch/artikel/geschichte_der_physik/from_static_to_expanding_models_of_the_universe_4/ From static to expanding model of universe-Quote Reference on Cosmo-Constant, SPS, May 2012]</ref> and Einstein supposedly discarded the cosmological constant.

Einstein believed a spherical static universe is philosophically preferred, because it would obey [[Mach's principle]]. He had shown that general relativity incorporates Mach's principle to a certain extent in frame dragging by gravitomagnetic fields, but he knew that Mach's idea would not work if space goes on forever. In a closed universe, he believed that Mach's principle would hold. Mach's principle has generated much controversy over the years.

In many of Einstein biographies, writers claim that he called the creation of Lambda his "biggest blunder". Recently, astrophysicist [[Mario Livio]] showed that Einstein possibly never said that.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/books/review/brilliant-blunders-by-mario-livio.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 'Brilliant BLunders' by Mario Livio, The New York TImes, Retireved 9 June 2013]</ref> Instead of discarding Lambda, Einstein was continually experimenting with it.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/news/einstein-s-lost-theory-uncovered-1.14767 Einstein's lost Theory uncovered: Physicist explored the idea of a steady-state Universe in 1931., Nature, Retrieved 24 February 2014]</ref>

In late 2013, Irish physicist Cormac O'Raifeartaigh, happened to discover a handwritten manuscript by Einstein which was since then overlooked by other scientists. The research paper was titled  <nowiki>''</nowiki>"Zum kosmologischen Problem"<nowiki>''</nowiki> ("About the Cosmological Problem").<ref>[arxiv.org/pdf/1402.0132 arXiv Archive of Einsteins Paper 1]</ref><ref>[arxiv.org/pdf/1312.2192 arXiv Archive of Einsteins Paper 1]</ref> And Einstein proposed a revision of his model, still with a cosmological constant, but now the constant was responsible for the creation of new matter as the universe expanded. Thus, the average density of the system never changed. He stated in the paper, <nowiki>''</nowiki>"In what follows, I would like to draw attention to a solution to equation (1) that can account for Hubbel's [sic] facts, and in which the density is constant over time." And: "If one considers a physically bounded volume, particles of matter will be continually leaving it. For the density to remain constant, new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space."<nowiki>''</nowiki>

This is consistent with the now-obsolete [[Steady State theory|Steady State model]] of cosmology, proposed later in 1949, and with today's modern understanding of [[dark energy]].<ref>[http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2014/03/07/einsteins-lost-theory-describes-a-universe-without-a-big-bang/#.Uya3EcHiG9U Einstein's lost theory describes a Universe without a Big Bang, Retrieved 7 March 2014]</ref>

===Modern quantum theory===
{{Main|Schrödinger equation}}
[[File:NYT May 4, 1935.jpg|thumb|Newspaper headline on May 4, 1935]]
Einstein was displeased with quantum theory and mechanics (the very theory he helped create), despite its acceptance by other physicists, stating that God "is not playing at dice."<ref>{{cite book |title=The New Penguin Dictionary of Modern Quotations |first1=Robert |last1=Andrews |publisher=Penguin UK |year=2003 |isbn=0-14-196531-2 |page=499 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VK0vR4fsaigC}}, [http://books.google.com/books?id=VK0vR4fsaigC&pg=PT499 Extract of page 499]</ref> Einstein continued to maintain his disbelief in the theory, and attempted unsuccessfully to disprove it until he died at the age of 76.<ref>[http://video.pbs.org/video/1512280538 Video: The Elegant Universe: Part 1 | Watch NOVA Online | PBS Video]. Video.pbs.org. Retrieved on 11 May 2012.</ref> In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in ''Physikalische Zeitschrift'' that proposed the possibility of [[stimulated emission]], the physical process that makes possible the [[maser]] and the [[laser]].<ref>{{Harv|Einstein|1917b}}</ref>
This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.
Einstein discovered [[Louis de Broglie]]'s work, and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for [[Matter wave|de Broglie waves]], which Einstein suggested was the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]] of mechanics. This paper would inspire Schrödinger's work of 1926.

===Bose–Einstein statistics===
{{Main|Bose–Einstein statistics}}
In 1924, Einstein received a description of a [[statistical mechanics|statistical]] model from Indian physicist [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]''. Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures.<ref>{{Harv|Einstein|1924}}</ref> It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by [[Eric Allin Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]] using [[ultracold atom|ultra-cooling]] equipment built at the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]–[[JILA]] laboratory at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]].<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/n01-04.htm|title=Cornell and Wieman Share 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics|date=9 October 2001|accessdate=11 June 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070610080506/http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/n01-04.htm| archivedate= 10 June 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of [[boson]]s. Einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.<ref name=Instituut-Lorentz/>

===Energy momentum pseudotensor===
{{Main|Stress-energy-momentum pseudotensor}}
General relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. [[Noether's theorem]] allows these quantities to be determined from a [[Lagrangian]] with [[Translational symmetry|translation invariance]], but [[general covariance]] makes translation invariance into something of a [[gauge symmetry]]. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.

Einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by [[Lev Landau]] and [[Evgeny Lifshitz]], and others, and has become standard.

The use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by [[Erwin Schrödinger]] and others.

===Unified field theory===
{{Main|Classical unified field theories}}
Following his research on general relativity, Einstein entered into a series of attempts to generalize his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as another aspect of a single entity. In 1950, he described his "[[unified field theory]]" in a ''[[Scientific American]]'' article entitled "On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation".<ref>{{Harv|Einstein|1950}}</ref> Although he continued to be lauded for his work, Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research, and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.
In his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the [[strong nuclear force|strong]] and [[weak nuclear force]]s, which were not well understood until many years after his death. Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein's approaches to unification. Einstein's dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a [[theory of everything]] and in particular [[string theory]], where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.

===Wormholes===
{{Main|Wormhole}}
Einstein collaborated with others to produce a model of a [[wormhole]]. His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper "Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?". These solutions cut and pasted [[Schwarzschild black hole]]s to make a bridge between two patches.

If one end of a wormhole was positively charged, the other end would be negatively charged. These properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way.

===Einstein–Cartan theory===
{{Main|Einstein–Cartan theory}}
[[File:Albert Einstein photo 1920.jpg|alt=Einstein, sitting at a table, looks up from the papers he is reading and into the camera.|thumb|upright|Einstein at his office, [[University of Berlin]], 1920]]In order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the [[Torsion tensor|torsion]]. This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s.

===Equations of motion===
{{Main|Einstein–Infeld–Hoffmann equations}}
The theory of general relativity has a fundamental law—the [[Einstein equations]] which describe how space curves, the [[geodesic equation]] which describes how particles move may be derived from the Einstein equations.

Since the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein equations themselves, not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.

This was established by Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum, and by [[Roy Kerr]] for spinning objects.

===Other investigations===
{{main|Einstein's unsuccessful investigations}}
Einstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned. These pertain to [[force]], [[superconductivity]], [[gravitational waves]], and other research.

===Collaboration with other scientists===
[[File:Solvay conference 1927.jpg|thumb|The 1927 [[Solvay Conference]] in Brussels, a gathering of the world's top physicists. Einstein in the center.]]
In addition to longtime collaborators [[Leopold Infeld]], [[Nathan Rosen]], [[Peter Bergmann]] and others, Einstein also had some one-shot collaborations with various scientists.

====Einstein–de Haas experiment====
{{Main|Einstein–de Haas effect}}
Einstein and De Haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a [[torsion pendulum]]. They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron's angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed to be sensitive, because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.

====Schrödinger gas model====
Einstein suggested to Erwin Schrödinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a [[Bose–Einstein condensate|Bose–Einstein gas]] by considering a box. Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator. Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.

This formulation is a form of [[second quantization]], but it predates modern quantum mechanics. Erwin Schrödinger applied this to derive the [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] properties of a [[Quantum chaos|semiclassical]] [[ideal gas]]. Schrödinger urged Einstein to add his name as co-author, although Einstein declined the invitation.<ref>{{Citation |last=Moore |first=Walter |year=1989 |title=Schrödinger: Life and Thought |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-43767-9}}</ref>

====Einstein refrigerator====

In 1926, Einstein and his former student Leó Szilárd co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the [[Einstein refrigerator]]. This [[absorption refrigerator]] was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input.<ref name="Goettling">Goettling, Gary.

===Bohr versus Einstein===
{{Main|Bohr–Einstein debates}}
[[File:Niels Bohr Albert Einstein by Ehrenfest.jpg|upright|alt=Two men sitting, looking relaxed. A dark-haired Bohr is talking while Einstein looks sceptical.|thumb|Einstein and [[Niels Bohr]], 1925]] The Bohr–Einstein debates were a series of public disputes about [[quantum mechanics]] between Albert Einstein and [[Niels Bohr]] who were two of its founders. Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the [[philosophy of science]].<ref name='Bohr1949'>{{cite web | url = http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/dk/bohr.htm | title = Discussions with Einstein on Epistemological Problems in Atomic Physics | accessdate =30 August 2010 | last = Bohr N | work=The Value of Knowledge: A Miniature Library of Philosophy | publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]]| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100913033345/http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/dk/bohr.htm| archivedate= 13 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}} From Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist (1949), publ.

===Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox===
{{Main|EPR paradox}}
In 1935, Einstein returned to the question of quantum mechanics. He considered how a measurement on one of two entangled particles would affect the other. He noted, along with his collaborators, that by performing different measurements on the distant particle, either of position or momentum, different properties of the entangled partner could be discovered without disturbing it in any way.

He then used a hypothesis of [[local realism]] to conclude that the other particle had these properties already determined. The principle he proposed is that if it is possible to determine what the answer to a position or momentum measurement would be, without in any way disturbing the particle, then the particle actually has values of position or momentum.

This principle distilled the essence of Einstein's objection to quantum mechanics. As a physical principle, it was shown to be incorrect when the [[Aspect experiment]] of 1982 confirmed [[Bell's theorem]], which had been promulgated in 1964.

==Non-scientific legacy==
While traveling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and Ilse. The letters were included in the papers bequeathed to [[The Hebrew University]]. Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DEFD9153FF931A25754C0A960948260 |title=Obituary |work=New York Times |date=12 July 1986 |accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref>). Barbara Wolff, of The Hebrew University's Albert Einstein Archives, told the [[BBC]] that there are about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955.<ref>{{Citation |title =Letters Reveal Einstein Love Life |journal=[[BBC News]] |publisher=BBC  |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5168002.stm |accessdate =14 March 2007 | date=11 July 2006}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
{{Main|Albert Einstein in popular culture}}
In the period before World War II, the ''[[New York Times]]'' published a vignette in their "The Talk of the Town" feature saying that Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain "that theory". He finally figured out a way to handle the incessant inquiries. He told his inquirers "Pardon me, sorry! Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein."<ref>[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1939/01/14/1939_01_14_011_TNY_CARDS_000176356 The New Yorker April 1939 pg 69]</ref>

Einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels, films, plays, and works of music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cindymctee.com/einsteins_dream.html |title=Einstein's Dream for orchestra |first=Cindy |last=McTee |publisher=Cindymctee.com |accessdate= }}</ref> He is a favorite model for depictions of [[mad scientist]]s and [[absent-minded professor]]s; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated.

Originally based on the [[English alphabet]], it encodes 128 specified [[character (computing)|characters]] into 7-bit binary integers as shown by the ASCII chart on the right.<ref>{{cite web |title=RFC 4949 |url=http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc4949 |date=August 2007 |author=R. Shirley |accessdate=2013-12-23}}</ref>  The characters encoded are [[number]]s ''0'' to ''9'', [[lowercase letter]]s ''a'' to ''z'', [[uppercase letter]]s ''A'' to ''Z'', basic [[punctuation symbol]]s, [[control code]]s that originated with [[Teletype machine]]s, and [[Space (punctuation)|space]]. For example, lowercase ''[[j]]'' would become [[binary number|binary]] 1101010 and [[decimal]] [[106 (number)|106]].

ASCII codes represent text in [[computer]]s, [[communications equipment]], and other devices that use text. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, though they support many additional characters.

ASCII developed from [[Telegraph code|telegraphic codes]]. Its first commercial use was as a 7-[[bit]] [[teleprinter]] code promoted by Bell data services.

==History==
The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) was developed under the auspices of a committee of the American Standards Association, called the X3 committee, by its X3.2 (later X3L2) subcommittee, and later by that subcommittee's X3.2.4 working group. The ASA became the United States of America Standards Institute or USASI<ref name="FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980211">[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p.&nbsp;211.</ref> and ultimately the [[American National Standards Institute]].

===Bit width===
The X3.2 subcommittee designed ASCII based on the earlier [[teleprinter]] encoding systems. Like other [[character encoding]]s, ASCII specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and [[character (computing)|character]] symbols (i.e. [[grapheme]]s and [[control character]]s). This allows [[Digital data|digital]] devices to communicate with each other and to process, store, and communicate character-oriented information such as written language. Before ASCII was developed, the encodings in use included 26 [[English alphabet|alphabetic]] characters, 10 [[numerical digit]]s, and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols. To include all these, and control characters compatible with the [[CCITT|Comité Consultatif International Téléphonique et Télégraphique]] (CCITT) [[International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2]] (ITA2) standard, [[Fieldata]], and early [[EBCDIC]], more than 64 codes were required for ASCII.

The committee debated the possibility of a [[Shift code|shift]] function (like in [[ITA2]]), which would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by a [[six-bit character code|six-bit code]]. In a shifted code, some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes. It allows compact encoding, but is less reliable for [[data transmission]]; an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable. The standards committee decided against shifting, and so ASCII required at least a seven-bit code.<ref name="FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980p. 215, Decision 4">[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p. 215, Decision 4.</ref>

The committee considered an eight-bit code, since eight bits ([[octet (computing)|octets]]) would allow two four-bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with [[binary-coded decimal]]. However, it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice. The committee voted to use a seven-bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission. Since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position, it also allowed for a [[parity bit]] for [[error checking]] if desired.<ref name="FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980p. 217, Decision 5">[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p. 217, Decision 5.</ref> [[Eight-bit]] machines (with octets as the native data type) that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to 0.<ref>{{cite book |authors=Stanley A.

===Organization===
The code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together, and all graphic codes were together, for ease of identification. The first two columns (32 positions) were reserved for control characters.<ref name="FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980p. 220, Decisions 8,9">[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p. 220, Decisions 8,9.</ref> The [[Space (punctuation)|"space" character]] had to come before graphics to make [[sorting algorithm|sorting]] easier, so it became position 20<sub>[[hexadecimal|hex]]</sub>;<ref name="FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980p. 237, Decision 10">[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p. 237, Decision 10.</ref> for the same reason, many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits.  The committee decided it was important to support [[upper case]] [[sixbit code pages|64-character alphabets]], and chose to pattern ASCII so it could be reduced easily to a usable 64-character set of graphic codes,<ref name="FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980p. 228, Decision 14">[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p. 228, Decision 14.</ref> as was done in the [[DEC SIXBIT]] code. [[Lower case]] letters were therefore not interleaved with upper case. To keep options available for lower case letters and other graphics, the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters, and the letter ''A'' was placed in position 41<sub>[[hexadecimal|hex]]</sub> to match the draft of the corresponding British standard.<ref name="FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980p. 238, Decision 18">[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p. 238, Decision 18.</ref> The digits 0–9 were arranged so they correspond to values in binary prefixed with 011, making conversion with [[binary-coded decimal]] straightforward.

Many of the non-alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters; an important subtlety is that these were based on ''mechanical'' typewriters, not ''electric'' typewriters.<ref name=savard>{{cite web

}}</ref> Mechanical typewriters followed the standard set by the Remington No. 2 (1878), the first typewriter with a shift key, and the shifted values of <code>23456789-</code> were <code>"#$%_&'()</code>{{snd}} early typewriters omitted ''0'' and ''1'', using ''O'' (capital letter ''o'') and ''l'' (lowercase letter ''L'') instead, but <code>1!</code> and <code>0)</code> pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common. Thus, in ASCII <code>!"#$%</code> were placed in second column, rows 1–5, corresponding to the digits 1–5 in the adjacent column. The parentheses could not correspond to ''9'' and ''0'', however, because the place corresponding to ''0'' was taken by the space character. This was accommodated by removing <code>_</code> (underscore) from ''6'' and shifting the remaining characters left; this corresponded to many European typewriters, which placed the parentheses with ''8'' and ''9''. This discrepancy from typewriters led to [[bit-paired keyboard]]s, notably the [[Teletype Model 33]], which used the left-shifted layout corresponding to ASCII, not to traditional mechanical typewriters. Electric typewriters, notably the more recently introduced [[IBM Selectric]] (1961), used a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computers{{mdashb}}following the [[IBM PC]] (1981), especially [[Model M]] (1984){{mdashb}}and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ASCII table as earlier keyboards did. The <code>/?</code> pair also dates to the No. 2, and the <code>,&lt; .&gt;</code> pairs were used on some keyboards (others, including the No. 2, did not shift <code>,</code> (comma) or <code>.</code> (full stop) so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting). However, ASCII split the <code>;:</code> pair (dating to No. 2), and rearranged mathematical symbols (varied conventions, commonly <code>-* =+</code>) to <code>:* ;+ -=</code>.

Some common characters were not included, notably <code>½¼¢</code>, while <code>^`~</code> were included as diacritics for international use, and <code>&lt;&gt;</code> for mathematical use, together with the simple line characters <code>\|</code> (in addition to common <code>/</code>). The ''@'' symbol was not used in continental Europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented ''À'' in the French variation, so the ''@'' was placed in position 40<sub>[[hexadecimal|hex]]</sub>, right before the letter A.<ref name="FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980243">[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p.&nbsp;243.</ref>

The control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message (SOM), end of address (EOA), [[End of Message|end of message]] (EOM), end of transmission (EOT), "who are you?" (WRU), "are you?" (RU), a reserved device control (DC0), synchronous idle (SYNC), and acknowledge (ACK). These were positioned to maximize the [[Hamming distance]] between their bit patterns.<ref name="FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980243-245">[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], pp.&nbsp;243-245.</ref>

===Publication===
With the other special characters and control codes filled in, ASCII was published as ASA X3.4-1963, leaving 28 code positions without any assigned meaning, reserved for future standardization, and one unassigned control code.<ref name="FOOTNOTEMackenzie198066, 245">[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], pp.&nbsp;66, 245.</ref> There was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lower case alphabet.<ref name="FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980435">[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p.&nbsp;435.</ref> The indecision did not last long: during May 1963 the CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet proposed to assign lower case characters to columns 6 and 7,<ref>Brief Report: Meeting of CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet, May 13–15, 1963.</ref> and [[International Organization for Standardization]] TC 97 SC 2 voted during October to incorporate the change into its draft standard.<ref>Report of ISO/TC/97/SC 2 – Meeting of October 29–31, 1963.</ref> The X3.2.4 task group voted its approval for the change to ASCII at its May 1963 meeting.<ref>Report on Task Group X3.2.4, June 11, 1963, Pentagon Building, Washington, DC.</ref>  Locating the lowercase letters in columns 6 and 7 caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit, which simplified [[case-insensitive]] character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers.

The X3 committee made other changes, including other new characters (the [[bracket|brace]] and [[vertical bar]] characters),<ref>Report of Meeting No. 8, Task Group X3.2.4, December 17 and 18, 1963</ref> renaming some control characters (SOM became start of header (SOH)) and moving or removing others (RU was removed).<ref name="FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980247–248">[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p.&nbsp;247–248.</ref> ASCII was subsequently updated as USASI X3.4-1967, then USASI X3.4-1968, ANSI X3.4-1977, and finally, ANSI X3.4-1986 (the first two are occasionally retronamed ANSI X3.4-1967, and ANSI X3.4-1968).

The X3 committee also addressed how ASCII should be transmitted ([[least significant bit]] first), and how it should be recorded on perforated tape. They proposed a [[9-track]] standard for magnetic tape, and attempted to deal with some forms of [[punched card]] formats.

===Use===
ASCII itself was first used commercially during 1963 as a seven-bit teleprinter code for [[American Telephone & Telegraph]]'s TWX (TeletypeWriter eXchange) network. TWX originally used the earlier five-bit [[ITA2]], which was also used by the competing [[Telex]] teleprinter system. [[Bob Bemer]] introduced features such as the [[Escape character|escape sequence]].<ref name="Brandel" /> His British colleague [[Hugh McGregor Ross]] helped to popularize this work—according to Bemer, "so much so that the code that was to become ASCII was first called the Bemer-Ross Code in Europe".<ref>Bob Bemer (n.d.).

On March 11, 1968, U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] mandated that all computers purchased by the United States federal government support ASCII, stating:<ref>Lyndon B. Johnson (March 11, 1968).

===Other standards===
Other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as [[ISO/IEC 646]] that are identical or nearly identical to ASCII, with extensions for characters outside the English [[alphabet]] and symbols used outside the United States, such as the symbol for the United Kingdom's [[pound sterling]] (£). Almost every country needed an adapted version of ASCII, since ASCII suited the needs of only the USA and a few other countries. For example, Canada had its own version that supported French characters. Other adapted encodings include [[ISCII]] (India), [[VISCII]] (Vietnam), and [[YUSCII]] (Yugoslavia). Although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ASCII, true ASCII is defined strictly only by the ANSI standard.

ASCII was incorporated into the [[Unicode]] character set as the first 128 symbols, so the 7-bit ASCII characters have the same numeric codes in both sets. This allows [[UTF-8]] to be [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with 7-bit ASCII, as a UTF-8 file containing only ASCII characters is identical to an ASCII file containing the same sequence of characters.  Even more importantly, [[forward compatibility]] is ensured as software that recognizes only 7-bit ASCII characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set (as is often done to support 8-bit ASCII extensions such as ISO-8859-1) will preserve UTF-8 data unchanged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/utf-8.7.html |title=utf-8(7) - Linux manual page |publisher=Man7.org |date=2014-02-26 |accessdate=2014-04-21}}</ref>

==ASCII control characters==
{{main|Control character}}

ASCII reserves the first 32 codes (numbers 0–31 decimal) for [[control character]]s: codes originally intended not to represent printable information, but rather to control devices (such as [[computer printer|printers]]) that make use of ASCII, or to provide [[Metadata|meta-information]] about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape.

For example, character 10 represents the "line feed" function (which causes a printer to advance its paper), and character 8 represents "backspace". RFC 2822 refers to control characters that do not include carriage return, line feed or [[Whitespace (computer science)|white space]] as non-whitespace control characters.<ref>RFC 2822 (April 2001). "NO-WS-CTL".</ref> Except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line-oriented formatting, ASCII does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document. Other schemes, such as [[markup language]]s, address page and document layout and formatting.

The original ASCII standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character. The ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional, for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a [[data stream]], and sometimes accidental, for example with the meaning of "delete".

Probably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR, which was a printing terminal with an available [[punched tape|paper tape]] reader/punch option. Paper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage until the 1980s, less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape. In particular, the Teletype Model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 (Control-Q, DC1, also known as XON), 19 (Control-S, DC3, also known as XOFF), and 127 ([[Delete key|Delete]]) became de facto standards. The Model 33 was also notable for taking the description of Control-G (BEL, meaning audibly alert the operator) literally; the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a BEL character.  Because the keytop for the O key also showed a left-arrow symbol (from ASCII-1963, which had this character instead of [[underscore]]), a noncompliant use of code 15 (Control-O, Shift In) interpreted as "delete previous character" was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected.

When a Teletype 33 ASR equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a Control-S (XOFF, an abbreviation for transmit off), it caused the tape reader to stop; receiving Control-Q (XON, "transmit on") caused the tape reader to resume.  This technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a "handshaking" signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow; it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique. On some systems Control-S retains its meaning but Control-Q is replaced by a second Control-S to resume output.  The 33 ASR also could be configured to employ Control-R (DC2) and Control-T (DC4) to start and stop the tape punch; on some units equipped with this function, the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was TAPE and <s>TAPE</s> respectively.<ref>{{cite web|last=McConnell|first=Robert|title=Understanding ASCII Codes|url=http://www.nadcomm.com/ascii_code.htm|accessdate=2014-05-11|author2=Haynes, James |author3=Warren, RIchard }}</ref>

Code 127 is officially named "delete" but the Teletype label was "rubout". Since the original standard did not give detailed interpretation for most control codes, interpretations of this code varied. The original Teletype meaning, and the intent of the standard, was to make it an ignored character, the same as NUL (all zeroes). This was useful specifically for paper tape, because punching the all-ones bit pattern on top of an existing mark would obliterate it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2014-05/msg00448.html|title=Re: editor and word processor history (was: Re: RTF for emacs)}}</ref> Tapes designed to be "hand edited" could even be produced with spaces of extra NULs (blank tape) so that a block of characters could be "rubbed out" and then replacements put into the empty space.

Some software assigned special meanings to ASCII characters sent to the software from the terminal. Operating systems from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], for example, interpreted DEL as an input character as meaning "remove previously-typed input character",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp6/DEC-6-0-EX-SYS-UM-IP-PRE00_Multiprogramming_System_Manual_1965.pdf|title=PDP-6 Multiprogramming System Manual|page=43|publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]]|year=1965}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp10/1970_PDP-10_Ref/1970PDP10Ref_Part3.pdf|title=PDP-10 Reference Handbook, Book 3, Communicating with the Monitor|page=5-5|publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]]|year=1969}}</ref> and this interpretation also became common in Unix systems. Most other systems used BS for that meaning and used DEL to mean "remove the character at the cursor".{{cn|date=July 2014}} That latter interpretation is the most common now.{{cn|date=July 2014}}

Many more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones. The "escape" character (ESC, code 27), for example, was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning. This is the same meaning of "escape" encountered in URL encodings, [[C (programming language)|C language]] strings, and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning. Over time this meaning has been co-opted and has eventually been changed. In modern use, an ESC sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence, usually in the form of a so-called "[[ANSI escape code]]" (or, more properly, a "[[Control Sequence Introducer]]") beginning with ESC followed by a "<nowiki>[</nowiki>" (left-bracket) character. An ESC sent from the terminal is most often used as an [[out-of-band data|out-of-band]] character used to terminate an operation, as in the [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]] and [[vi]] [[text editor]]s. In [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) and [[window (computing)|windowing]] systems, ESC generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to [[exit (operating system)|exit]] (terminate) altogether.

The inherent ambiguity of many control characters, combined with their historical usage, created problems when transferring "plain text" files between systems. The best example of this is the [[newline]] problem on various [[operating system]]s. Teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both "Carriage Return" (which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line) and "Line Feed" (which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead). The name "Carriage Return" comes from the fact that on a manual [[typewriter]] the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary.  The entire carriage had to be pushed (returned) to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line.

[[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] operating systems ([[OS/8]], [[RT-11]], [[RSX-11]], [[RSTS/E|RSTS]], [[TOPS-10]], etc.) used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device (originally [[Teleprinter|Teletype machines]]) would work. By the time so-called "glass TTYs" (later called CRTs or terminals) came along, the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention. When [[Gary Kildall]] cloned [[RT-11]] to create [[CP/M]] he followed established [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] convention.  Until the introduction of [[PC DOS]] in 1981, [[IBM]] had no hand in this because their 1970s operating systems used EBCDIC instead of ASCII and they were oriented toward punch-card input and line printer output on which the concept of "carriage return" was meaningless. IBM's [[PC DOS]] (also marketed as [[MS-DOS]] by Microsoft) inherited the convention by virtue of being a clone of [[CP/M]], and [[Windows]] inherited it from MS-DOS.

Unfortunately, requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone. To simplify matters [[plain text]] data streams, including files, on [[Multics]]<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://www.multicians.org/jhs-jfo-terminals.pdf |title=Technical and human engineering problems in connecting terminals to a time-sharing system |last1=Ossanna |first1=J.

[[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems, and [[Amiga]] systems, adopted this convention from Multics. The original [[Macintosh OS]], [[Apple DOS]], and [[ProDOS]], on the other hand, used carriage return (CR) alone as a line terminator; however, since Apple replaced it with the Unix-based [[OS X]] operating system, they now use line feed (LF) as well.

Computers attached to the [[ARPANET]] included machines running operating systems such as TOPS-10 and [[TOPS-20#TENEX|TENEX]] using CR-LF line endings, machines running operating systems such as Multics using LF line endings, and machines running operating systems such as [[OS/360]] that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and that used [[EBCDIC]] rather than ASCII.  The [[Telnet]] protocol defined an ASCII "Network Virtual Terminal" (NVT), so that connections between hosts with different line-ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network; it used ASCII, along with CR-LF line endings, and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the NVT.<ref>{{cite IETF|title=TELNET Protocol|rfc=158|pages=4-5|author=T.

Older operating systems such as TOPS-10, along with CP/M, tracked file length only in units of disk blocks and used Control-Z (SUB) to mark the end of the actual text in the file.  For this reason, EOF, or [[end-of-file]], was used colloquially and conventionally as a [[three-letter acronym]] (TLA) for Control-Z instead of SUBstitute.  For a variety of reasons, the end-of-text code, [[End-of-text character|ETX]] aka [[Control-C]], was inappropriate and using Z as the control code to end a file is analogous to it ending the alphabet, a very convenient [[Mnemonic device|mnemonic aid]]. An historic common, and still prevalent, convention uses the [[End-of-text character|ETX]] aka [[Control-C]] code convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream, usually from a keyboard.

In C library and [[Unix]] conventions, the [[null character]] is used to terminate text [[string (computer science)|strings]]; such [[null-terminated string]]s can be known in abbreviation as ASCIZ or ASCIIZ, where here Z stands for "zero".

To delete the previous character, one had to back up the paper tape punch, which for mechanical and simplicity reasons was a button on the punch itself and not the keyboard, then type the rubout character. They therefore placed a key producing rubout at the location used on typewriters for backspace. When systems used these terminals and provided command-line editing, they had to use the "rubout" code to perform a backspace, and often did not interpret the backspace character (they might echo "<tt>^H</tt>" for backspace). Other terminals not designed for paper tape made the key at this location produce Backspace, and systems designed for these used that character to back up. Since the delete code often produced a backspace effect, this also forced terminal manufacturers to make any {{keypress|Delete}} key produce something other than the Delete character.</ref>

==ASCII printable characters==
<!-- Section header linked to from redirects -->
Codes 20<sub>[[hexadecimal|hex]]</sub> to 7E<sub>[[hexadecimal|hex]]</sub>, known as the printable characters, represent letters, digits, [[punctuation marks]], and a few miscellaneous symbols. There are 95 printable characters in total.{{efn|Printed out, the characters are: {{Pre2|scroll|<nowiki> !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~</nowiki>}}}}

Code 20<sub>[[hexadecimal|hex]]</sub>, the [[Space (punctuation)|space character]], denotes the space between words, as produced by the space-bar of a keyboard. Since the space character is considered an invisible graphic (rather than a control character)<ref name="FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980223" /><ref name="RFC20_1968" /> and thus would not normally be visible, it is represented here by [[Unicode]] character U+2420 "␠"; Unicode characters U+2422 "␢" and U+2423 "␣" are also available for use when a visible representation of a space is necessary.

Code 7F<sub>[[hexadecimal|hex]]</sub> corresponds to the non-printable "Delete" (DEL) control character and is therefore omitted from this chart; it is covered in the previous section's chart.  Earlier versions of ASCII used the up-arrow instead of the [[caret]] (5E<sub>[[hexadecimal|hex]]</sub>) and the left-arrow instead of the [[underscore]] (5F<sub>[[hexadecimal|hex]]</sub>).<ref>[http://www.worldpowersystems.com/projects/codes/X3.4-1963/index.html ASA X3.4-1963].</ref>

==Aliases==
A June 1992 RFC<ref>RFC 1345 (June 1992).</ref> and the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] registry of character sets<ref name="IANA" /> recognize the following case-insensitive aliases for ASCII as suitable for use on the Internet:

{{Div col||25em}}
* ANSI_X3.4-1968 (canonical name)
* iso-ir-6
* ANSI_X3.4-1986
* ISO_646.irv:1991
* ASCII
* ISO646-US
* US-ASCII (preferred [[MIME]] name)<ref name="IANA">Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (May 14, 2007). "[http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets Character Sets]". Accessed 2008-04-14.</ref>
* us
* IBM367
* cp367
* csASCII
{{Div col end}}

Of these, the IANA encourages use of the name "US-ASCII" for Internet uses of ASCII (even if it is a [[RAS syndrome|redundant acronym]], but the US is needed because of abuse of the ASCII term). One often finds this in the optional "charset" parameter in the Content-Type header of some MIME messages, in the equivalent "meta" element of some [[HTML]] documents, and in the encoding declaration part of the prologue of some [[XML]] documents.

==Variants==
As computer technology spread throughout the world, different [[Standardization|standards bodies]] and corporations developed many variations of ASCII to facilitate the expression of non-English languages that used Roman-based alphabets. One could class some of these variations as "[[Extended ASCII|ASCII extensions]]", although some misuse that term to represent all variants, including those that do not preserve ASCII's character-map in the 7-bit range. Furthermore the ASCII extensions have also been mislabelled as ASCII.

Many other countries developed variants of ASCII to include non-English letters (e.g. [[é]], [[ñ]], [[ß]], [[Ł]]), currency symbols (e.g. [[£]], [[¥]]), etc.

The [[PETSCII]] code [[Commodore International]] used for their [[8-bit]] systems is probably unique among post-1970 codes in being based on ASCII-1963, instead of the more common ASCII-1967, such as found on the [[ZX Spectrum character set|ZX Spectrum]] computer. [[ATASCII|Atari]] 8-bit computers and [[Galaksija (computer)#Character ROM|Galaksija]] computers also used ASCII variants.

===7-bit===
From early in its development,<ref>"Specific Criteria," attachment to memo from R. W. Reach, "X3-2 Meeting – September 14 and 15," September 18, 1961</ref> ASCII was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard, ultimately published as [[ISO/IEC 646]] (1972), which would share most characters in common but assign other locally useful characters to several [[code point]]s reserved for "national use."  However, the four years that elapsed between the publication of ASCII-1963 and ISO's first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967<ref>R. Maréchal, ISO/TC 97 – Computers and Information Processing: Acceptance of Draft ISO Recommendation No. 1052, December 22, 1967</ref> caused ASCII's choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world, causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points.

ISO/IEC 646, like ASCII, was a 7-bit character set. It did not make any additional codes available, so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries. Escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text, but they were rarely used, so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and therefore which character a code represented, and in general, text-processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway.

Because the bracket and brace characters of ASCII were assigned to "national use" code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of ISO/IEC 646, a German, French, or Swedish, etc. programmer using their national variant of ISO/IEC 646, rather than ASCII, had to write, and thus read, something such as
:<code>ä aÄiÜ='Ön'; ü</code>
instead of
:<code>{ a[i]='\n'; }</code>
[[C trigraph]]s were created to solve this problem for [[ANSI C]], although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use. Many programmers kept their computers on US-ASCII, so plain-text in Swedish, German etc. (for example, in e-mail or [[Usenet]]) contained "{, }" and similar variants in the middle of words, something those programmers got used to.

===8-bit===
Eventually, as 8-, [[16-bit|16-]] and [[32-bit]] (and later [[64-bit]]) computers began to replace [[18-bit|18-]] and [[36-bit]] computers as the norm, it became common to use an 8-bit byte to store each character in memory, providing an opportunity for extended, 8-bit, relatives of ASCII. In most cases these developed as true extensions of ASCII, leaving the original character-mapping intact, but adding additional character definitions after the first 128 (i.e., 7-bit) characters.

Most early home computer systems developed their own 8-bit character sets containing line-drawing and game glyphs, and often filled in some or all of the control characters from 0-31 with more graphics. [[Kaypro]] [[CP/M]] computers used the "upper" 128 characters for the Greek alphabet. The IBM PC defined [[code page 437]], which replaced the control-characters with graphic symbols such as [[Emoticon|smiley faces]], and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions. Operating systems such as [[DOS]] supported these code-pages, and manufacturers of [[IBM PC]]s supported them in hardware. [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] developed the [[Multinational Character Set]] (DEC-MCS) for use in the popular [[VT220]] [[computer terminal|terminal]]; this was one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics. The Macintosh defined [[Mac OS Roman]] and Postscript also defined a set, both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics, more like modern character sets. The [[ISO/IEC 8859]] standard (derived from the DEC-MCS) finally provided a standard that most systems copied (at least as accurately as they copied ASCII, but with many substitutions). A popular further extension designed by Microsoft, [[Windows-1252]] (often mislabeled as ISO-8859-1), added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing.

ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252, and the original 7-bit ASCII were the most common character encodings until 2008 when [[UTF-8]] became more common.<ref name="utf-8-2008" />

===Unicode===
[[Unicode]] and the ISO/IEC 10646 [[Universal Character Set]] (UCS) have a much wider array of characters, and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant ISO/IEC 8859 and ASCII rapidly in many environments. While ASCII is limited to 128 characters, Unicode and the UCS support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification (using [[natural number]]s called ''code points'') and encoding (to 8-, 16- or 32-bit binary formats, called [[UTF-8]], [[UTF-16]] and [[UTF-32]]).

To allow backward compatibility, the 128 ASCII and 256 ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) characters are assigned Unicode/UCS code points that are the same as their codes in the earlier standards. Therefore, ASCII can be considered a 7-bit encoding scheme for a very small subset of Unicode/UCS, and ASCII (when prefixed with 0 as the eighth bit) is valid UTF-8.

==Order==
ASCII-code order is also called ''ASCIIbetical'' order.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=ASCIIbetical&i=38025,00.asp |title=ASCIIbetical definition |magazine=[[PC Magazine]] |accessdate=2008-04-14}}</ref>
[[Collation]] of data is sometimes done in this order rather than "standard" alphabetical order ([[collating sequence]]). The main deviations in ASCII order are:
* All uppercase come before lowercase letters, for example, "Z" before "a"
* Digits and many punctuation marks come before letters; for example, "4" precedes "one"
* Numbers are sorted naïvely as strings; for example, "10" precedes "2"

An intermediate order—readily implemented—converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ASCII values. Naïve number sorting can be averted by [[Leading zero|zero-filling]] all numbers (e.g. "02" will sort before "10" as expected), although this is an external fix and has nothing to do with the ordering itself.

'''''NFL on NBC''''' is the brand given to [[NBC Sports]] coverage of [[National Football League]] games until 1998, when [[NBC]] lost the NFL [[American Football Conference]] [[NFL on CBS|rights]] to [[CBS]]. NFL coverage returned to NBC on Sunday, August 6, [[2006 NFL season|2006]] under the title '''''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]],'''''<ref>http://www.ge.com/stories/en/20346.html?category=Product_Home</ref> beginning its pre-season with coverage of the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game|NFL Hall of Fame Game]].

==History==

===Beginnings through the 1950s===
The program (which has aired under numerous program titles and formats) actually goes back to the beginnings of NBC's relationship with the NFL in [[1939 NFL season|1939]], when they (technically, NBC's [[flagship station]] out of New York, which was then known as [[W2XBS]]) aired the first-ever televised pro football game between the [[1939 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] and the now defunct [[1939 Brooklyn Dodgers (NFL) season|Brooklyn Dodgers]] football team.

By [[1955 NFL season|1955]], NBC became the televised home to the NFL Championship Game, paying US$100,000 to the league. NBC had taken over broadcast rights from [[NFL on DuMont|DuMont]], which had struggled to give the league a national audience (NBC's coverage of proto-[[Canadian Football League]] games was more widely available at the time) and was on the brink of failure; the NFL's associations with NBC (as well as with CBS) proved to be a boost to the league's popularity. The ''[[1958 NFL Championship Game]]'' played at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] between the [[1958 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]] and the [[1958 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] went into sudden death overtime. This game, known since as the "''Greatest Game Ever Played''", was seen by many throughout the country and is credited with increasing the popularity of professional football in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

From [[1955 NFL season|1955]]–[[1963 NFL season|1963]], NBC televised the [[NFL Championship Game]], the precursor to the [[Super Bowl]]. The contract for the title game was separate than the regular season contract held by [[NFL on CBS|CBS]], who started televising NFL games in [[1956 NFL season|1956]]. Prior to [[1962 NFL season|1962]], each team had its own individual television contract.

NBC also had the rights to the televise [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] home games in [[1959 NFL season|1959]], [[1960 NFL season|1960]] and [[1961 NFL season|1961]]. While blacked out in Pittsburgh and Baltimore, games were seen on other NBC stations. In some cases, the broadcast was seen on [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] in the visiting team's home region. NBC covered 11 games in 1960 and 13 games in 1961 in a "''Game of the Week''" format. NBC would take one week off due to its coverage of the [[1961 World Series|World Series]].

During this era, NBC broadcast edited videotapes (one hour, including commercials) of its games in the off-season under the title "Best of Pro Football".

{{see also|1960 Pittsburgh Steelers season|1960 Baltimore Colts season|1961 Pittsburgh Steelers season|1961 Baltimore Colts season}}

NBC also during this period had the rights to the [[Pro Bowl]] (which was also under a separate contract from the NFL's regular season and the NFL Championship Game) via the Los Angeles newspapers' charities. NBC televised the Pro Bowl following the [[1951 NFL season|1951]] and [[1952 NFL season|1952 seasons]] and again from the [[1957 NFL season|1957]]–[[1964 NFL season|1964 seasons]].

===1960s===
On April 5, 1961, NBC was awarded a two-year contract (1961–62) for radio and television rights to the [[NFL Championship Game]] for US$615,000 annually, $300,000 of which was to go directly into the [[NFL Player Benefit Plan]]. On May 23, 1963, NBC was awarded exclusive network broadcasting rights for the 1963 NFL Championship Game for $926,000.

NBC resumed football telecasts on a regular basis in [[American Football League seasons#1965|1965]]. With NBC paying the [[American Football League]] US$36 million on January 29, 1965 to televise its games, and the increased, heated battle over college prospects, both leagues negotiated a [[AFL-NFL Merger|merger]] agreement on June 8, 1966. Although they would not officially adopt an interlocking schedule until [[1970 NFL season|1970]], two of the conditions of the agreement were that the winners of each league's championship game would meet in a contest (which would eventually become known as the Super Bowl) to determine the "''world champion of football''", and that there would be a common player draft.

On December 13, 1966, the rights to the Super Bowl for four years were sold to CBS and NBC for $9.5 million. The first ever '''''[[Super Bowl I|AFL-NFL World Championship Game]]''''' was played on January 15, 1967. Because [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] held the rights to nationally televise NFL games and NBC had the rights to broadcast AFL games, it was decided by the newly merged league to have both of them cover that first game, though only CBS' cameras and technical crew were allowed to work the game with NBC picking up the CBS video feed, but with NBC's own commentators. The next three AFL-NFL World Championship Games, later renamed the ''[[Super Bowl]]'', were then divided by the two networks: CBS broadcast Super Bowls [[Super Bowl II|II]] and [[Super Bowl IV|IV]] while NBC covered [[Super Bowl III|III]].

====''The Heidi Game''====
{{details|Heidi Game}}
One of the most remembered games on NBC was a [[American Football League seasons#1968|1968]] game known as the ''[[Heidi Game]]''. With its nationally-televised game between the [[1968 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] and [[1968 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] running late, the network began to show the movie ''[[Heidi]]'' just moments after the Jets' [[Jim Turner (placekicker)|Jim Turner]] kicked what appeared to be the game-winning field goal with 1:05 remaining. While millions of irate fans, missing the finale, jammed NBC's phone lines, the Raiders scored 2 touchdowns in eight seconds during the final minute to win 43–32.

The reaction to ''The Heidi Game'' resulted in the AFL, and most other sports leagues, demanding that networks thereafter televise all games to their conclusion. NFL contracts with the networks now require games to be shown in a team's market area to the conclusion, regardless of the score.

To avoid a repeat incident, a 1975 NBC broadcast of ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'' was delayed until the completion of a [[1975 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]]–[[1975 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] game.

At NBC, the network installed a new phone in the control room wired to a separate exchange, becoming known as the ''Heidi Phone'', to prevent this situation from occurring in the future.

*[[Super Bowl I]] – As previously mentioned, the first ever Super Bowl is the only Super Bowl to have been broadcast in the United States by two television networks simultaneously (no other NFL game was subsequently carried nationally on more than one network until December 29, [[2007 NFL season|2007]], when the [[2007 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] [[2007 New England Patriots-New York Giants game|faced]] the [[2007 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] on NBC, CBS, and the [[NFL Network]]). At the time, [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] held the rights to nationally televise NFL games while NBC had the rights to broadcast AFL games. It was decided to have both of them cover the game. Each network used its own announcers: [[Ray Scott (sportscaster)|Ray Scott]] (doing play-by-play for the first half), [[Jack Whitaker]] (doing play-by-play for the second half), and [[Frank Gifford]] provided commentary on CBS; while [[Curt Gowdy]] and [[Paul Christman]] were on NBC. NBC did have some problems. The network did not return in time from a [[halftime]] commercial break for the start of the second half; therefore, the first [[Kickoff (American football)|kickoff]] was stopped by the game's officials and was redone once NBC was back on the air. NBC was also forced to broadcast the game over CBS' feed and cameras (CBS received prerogative to use its feed and camera angles since the Coliseum was home to the NFL's Rams). In other words, NBC's crew had little to no control over how the game was shot.

*[[Super Bowl III]] – When NBC Sports broadcast Super Bowl III, they were at the time, still a "Service of [[NBC News]]" (indeed, sports at NBC would remain a part of the news division until well into the 1970s, long after both CBS and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] had moved sports out of their news divisions into their own separate departments). [[Curt Gowdy]] handled the [[play-by-play]] duties and was joined by [[color commentator]]s [[Al DeRogatis]] and [[Kyle Rote]] in the broadcast booth. Also helping with NBC's coverage were [[Jim Simpson (sportscaster)|Jim Simpson]] (reporting from the sidelines) and [[Pat Summerall]] (helping conduct player interviews for the pregame show, along with Rote). In an interview later done with [[NFL Films]], Gowdy called it the most memorable game he ever called because of its historical significance.<ref name=Sandomir>Richard Sandomir, TV SPORTS; Two Generations of Reminiscences by Gowdys, The New York Times, January 24, 1995, http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DD1E3FF937A15752C0A963958260&sec=&spon=&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink</ref> While the Orange Bowl was sold out for the game, the live telecast was not shown in Miami due to both leagues' unconditional [[blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] rules at the time. This game is thought to be the earliest surviving Super Bowl game preserved on videotape in its entirety save for a portion of the [[1968 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]]' fourth quarter scoring drive.

===1970s===
Beginning in [[1970 NFL season|1970]], NBC aired [[American Football Conference|AFC]] games until the [[1997 NFL season|1997 season]] (that is, the season that started in 1997 and [[Super Bowl XXXII|ended in 1998]]).

[[Curt Gowdy]], who covered the first five seasons of the [[American Football League]] with broadcast partner [[Paul Christman]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], moved over to NBC in the fall of 1965. For the next decade, Gowdy was the lead play-by-play announcer for the network for both [[American Football League|AFL]] [[American football|football]] ([[American Football Conference|AFC]] from 1970 on) and [[Major League Baseball on NBC|Major League Baseball]], but Gowdy also covered a wide range of sports, earning him the nickname of the "broadcaster of everything." Besides Paul Christman, Curt Gowdy's other football broadcast partners were [[Kyle Rote]], [[Al DeRogatis]], [[Don Meredith]], [[John Brodie]], and [[Merlin Olsen]].

On January 17, 1971, NBC's telecast of [[Super Bowl V]] between the [[1970 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]] and [[1970 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] was viewed in an estimated 23,980,000 homes, the largest audience ever for a one-day sports event. On January 14, 1973, NBC's telecast of [[Super Bowl VII]] between the [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] and [[1972 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] was viewed by approximately 75 million people. NBC's telecast of [[Super Bowl IX]] between the [[1974 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] and [[1974 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] was viewed by approximately 78 million people.

On December 16, [[1973 NFL season|1973]], NBC cameras were there to cover [[O. J. Simpson]] as he rushed for 2,000 yards in one season. On that particular day, Simpson's [[1973 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] would go on to beat the [[1973 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] at [[Shea Stadium]].

In [[1975 NFL season|1975]], because of NBC's coverage of Game 2 of the [[1975 World Series|World Series]] between the [[1975 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] and [[1975 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]], NBC's 1&nbsp;pm NFL telecasts were cancelled. All games except [[1975 New England Patriots season|New England]] at [[1975 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati]] were picked up by local stations in visiting team markets. Meanwhile, at 4&nbsp;pm, NBC showed [[1975 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland]] at [[1975 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City]] nationally. As the 1975 World Series progressed, NBC would advertise its upcoming weekend schedule during the breaks. They said, {{cquote|If we have a Game 7, we'll have ''The Baseball World of Joe Garagiola'' at 12:30 and Game 7 from [[Fenway Park|Fenway]]. Otherwise, we'll have ''[[The NFL on NBC Pregame Show#GrandStand|GrandStand]]'' at 12:30, and [[1975 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo]]/[[1975 Miami Dolphins season|Miami]] for most of you at 1:00. Either way, you win at NBC.}}

As it turned out, no baseball was played that Sunday. Three days of rain in Boston forced Game 6 to be postponed until the following Tuesday, October 21, followed by Game 7 the next night.

On January 9, 1977, 81.9 million people (the largest ever to view a sports event at that point) watched NBC's telecast of [[Super Bowl XI]] between the [[1976 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] and [[1976 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]]. Only three other television events prior to that time, all of which aired on all three commercial networks of the era (the funeral of President [[John F. Kennedy]], the 1969 moonwalk of [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]]; and the 1974 resignation speech of President [[Richard M. Nixon]]), attracted more viewers that did Super Bowl IX.

On October 12, [[1977 NFL season|1977]], Commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] negotiated contracts with the three television networks to televise all NFL regular season and postseason games, plus selected preseason games, for four years beginning with the [[1978 NFL season|1978 season]]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] was awarded yearly rights to 16 [[Monday Night Football|Monday night games]], four prime time games, the [[Pro Bowl|AFC-NFC Pro Bowl]], and the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game|Hall of Fame Games]]. [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] received the rights to all [[National Football Conference|NFC]] regular season and postseason games (except those in the ABC package) and to Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XIV|XIV]] and [[Super Bowl XVI|XVI]]. NBC received the rights to all [[American Football Conference|AFC]] regular-season and postseason games (except those in the ABC package) and to Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XIII|XIII]] and [[Super Bowl XV|XV]]. Industry sources considered it the largest single television package ever negotiated.

After the [[1975 World Series]], Curt Gowdy was removed from [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC's baseball telecasts]], when sponsor [[Chrysler]] insisted on having [[Joe Garagiola, Sr.|Joe Garagiola]] (who was their spokesman in many commercials) be the lead play-by-play voice. Gowdy continued as NBC's lead NFL announcer through the [[1978 NFL season|1978 season]], with his final broadcast being the memorable [[Super Bowl XIII]] between [[1978 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh]] and [[1978 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas]]. With NBC now anxious to promote [[Dick Enberg]] (who hosted NBC's pre-game and post-game coverage of Super Bowl XIII) to the lead NFL position, Gowdy moved over to [[CBS Sports|CBS]] to call more [[NFL on CBS|football]], as well as [[Major League Baseball on CBS Radio|baseball on radio]].

NBC's January 21, 1979 telecast of [[Super Bowl XIII]] between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Dallas Cowboys was viewed in 35,090,000 homes, by an estimated 96.6 million fans.

*[[Immaculate Reception]] – In 1998, during halftime of the AFC Championship Game, NBC showed a replay from its original broadcast.  The replay presented a different angle than the [[NFL Films]] clip that is most often shown.  According to a writer for the ''[[New York Daily News]]'', "NBC's replay showed the ball clearly hit one and only one man[:] Oakland DB Jack Tatum."<ref>Raissman, Bob, "With NFL, Networks Can't Win for Losing," New York Daily News, January 13, 1998, p.57.</ref>

*[[Super Bowl V]] – Super Bowl V featured [[Play-by-play|play-by-play announcer]] [[Curt Gowdy]] and [[color commentator]] [[Kyle Rote]]. Although the [[Orange Bowl]] was sold out for the event, unconditional [[blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] rules in the NFL prohibited the live telecast from being shown in the Miami area. The blackout was challenged in Miami-Dade District Court by attorney [[Ellis Rubin]], and although the judge denied Rubin's request since he felt he did not have the power to overrule the NFL, he agreed with Rubin's argument that the blackout rule was unnecessary for the Super Bowl.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40B10FE3A55127B93C6A8178AD85F458785F9|title=All of a Sudden, Miami Is Excited About Super Bowl, as Indicated by TV Blackout Fight|author=William N. Wallace|work=The New York Times|date=January 14, 1971}}</ref>

*[[Super Bowl VII]] – Super Bowl VII featured [[Play-by-play|play-by-play announcer]] [[Curt Gowdy]] and [[color commentator]] [[Al DeRogatis]]. This was the first Super Bowl to be televised live in the city in which it was being played. Despite unconditional [[blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] rules in the NFL that normally would have prohibited the live telecast from being shown locally, the NFL allowed the game to be telecast in the Los Angeles area on an experimental basis when all tickets for the game were sold. The league then changed its blackout rules the following season to allow games sold out at least 72 hours in advance to be televised in the host market. No subsequent Super Bowl has ever been blacked out in the city is has been played in, since all of them have been sold out.

*[[Super Bowl IX]] – Super Bowl IX featured [[play-by-play|play-by-play announcer]] [[Curt Gowdy]] and [[color commentator]]s [[Al DeRogatis]] and [[Don Meredith]].

*[[Super Bowl XI]] – Super Bowl XI featured [[Sports commentary|play-by-play announcer]] [[Curt Gowdy]] and [[color commentator]] [[Don Meredith]]. This was Meredith's last broadcast with NBC, as he returned to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] to rejoin the ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' crew for the [[1977 NFL season|1977 season]], where he had been a commentator from 1970–73. [[Bryant Gumbel]] and [[Lee Leonard]] with analyst [[John Brodie]] anchored NBC's pregame, halftime and postgame coverage.

*[[Super Bowl XIII]] – Super Bowl XIII featured [[Curt Gowdy]] handling [[play-by-play]] and [[color commentator]]s [[Merlin Olsen]] and [[John Brodie]]. [[Dick Enberg]] served as the pregame host for the broadcast. Also taking part in NBC's coverage were [[Bryant Gumbel]] and [[Mike Adamle]]. This was Gowdy's seventh and final Super Bowl telecast, and his last major event for NBC before moving to [[CBS Sports|CBS]] later in 1979. Enberg had essentially succeeded Gowdy as NBC's lead NFL play-by-play announcer in the 1978 regular season, and network producers didn't decide until nearly the last minute which man would get the Super Bowl call. NBC preceded the game with the first network broadcast of ''[[Black Sunday (1977 film)|Black Sunday]]'', a 1977 motion picture that depicts a terrorist attack on a fictitious Super Bowl game in the Orange Bowl between Pittsburgh and Dallas (and which utilized footage shot during [[Super Bowl X]]). The pregame festivities featured the [[Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders]] and several military bands. [[The Colgate Thirteen]] performed the national anthem. The [[coin flipping|coin toss]] ceremony featured [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]r and longtime [[Chicago Bears]] owner/head coach [[George Halas]]. The national radio broadcast of Super Bowl XIII was carried by the [[NFL on CBS Radio|CBS Radio]] Network, with [[Jack Buck]] and [[Hank Stram]] calling the action. Locally, [[Verne Lundquist]] and [[Brad Sham]] called the game for the Cowboys on [[KRLD (AM)|KRLD]]-AM in Dallas, while [[Jack Fleming]] and [[Myron Cope]] called it for the Steelers on [[WEAE|WTAE]]-AM in Pittsburgh. A technical glitch led to Fleming and Cope's commentary going out over NBC's television broadcast in place of the network's own audio during the coin toss ceremony.

===1980s===
NBC made history in the 1980s with an announcerless telecast (a one-shot experiment credited to [[Don Ohlmeyer]], between the [[1980 New York Jets season|Jets]] and [[1980 Miami Dolphins season|Dolphins]] in [[Miami Orange Bowl|Miami]] on December 20, [[1980 NFL season|1980]] known as the "silent game"), as well as a single-announcer telecast, coverage of the [[1982 CFL season|Canadian Football League]]<ref>{{Wayback |date=20091027100149 |url=http://www.geocities.com/cfl_historical/CFL-NBC.htm |title=CFL on NBC }}</ref><ref>[http://the506.com/yabb/YaBB.pl?num=1229553539 CFL on NBC in 1982]</ref> during the [[1982 NFL season|1982]] players' strike (the first week of broadcasts featured the ''NFL on NBC'' [[List of NFL on NBC commentator pairings#1982.5B20.5D|broadcast teams]], before a series of blowout games on the network and the resulting low [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] resulted in NBC cutting back and eventually canceling its CFL coverage), and even the [[Gayle Sierens|first female play-by-play football announcer]] (which in its own way set the mold for female sportscasters of today).

Television [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] in [[1980 NFL season|1980]] were the second-best in NFL history, trailing only the combined ratings of the [[1976 NFL season|1976 season]]. All three networks posted gains, and NBC's 15.0 rating was its best ever. [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] and [[Monday Night Football|ABC]] had their best ratings since [[1977 NFL season|1977]], with 15.3 and 20.8 ratings, respectively. In [[1981 NFL season|1981]], ABC and CBS set all-time rating highs. ABC finished with a 21.7 rating and CBS with a 17.5 rating. NBC however, was down slightly to 13.9; this was, at the time, the nadir of the [[Fred Silverman]] era, when ratings for the network were down across the board.

In 1982, the NFL signed a five-year contract with the three television networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC) to televise all NFL regular season and postseason games starting with the [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]].

On March 6, 1985, [[NBC Radio Network|NBC Radio]] and the NFL entered into a two-year agreement granting NBC the radio rights to a 37-game package in each of the [[1985 NFL season|1985]]–[[1986 NFL season|1986 seasons]]. The package included 27 regular season games and 10 postseason games. Also in 1985, the NFL showed a ratings increase on all three networks for the season, gaining 4 percent on NBC, 10 on CBS, and 16 on ABC.

The [[1985 NFL season|1985 season]] saw a new theme utilized throughout both the pregame show and game-opening sequence. This theme would be utilized for the remainder of the decade. Another music selection was used for the "Great Moments" segment, a segment of clips from older games on NBC that was unique in that instead of the [[NFL Films]] footage, NBC used their own footage and audio. This segment would be featured at the beginning of the pregame show for much of the latter part of the 1980s.

On January 26, 1986, the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] defeated the [[1985 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] 46–10 in [[Super Bowl XX]] at the [[Louisiana Superdome]]. The NBC telecast replaced the [[Goodbye, Farewell and Amen|final episode of ''M*A*S*H'']] as the most-viewed television program in history, with an audience of 127 million viewers, according to A.C. Nielsen figures. In addition to drawing a 48.3 rating and a 70 percent share in the United States, Super Bowl XX was televised to 59 foreign countries and beamed via satellite to the [[RMS Queen Elizabeth 2|QE II]]. An estimated 300 million [[List of Chinese-language television channels|Chinese]] viewed a tape delay of the game in March. NBC Radio figures indicated an audience of 10 million for the game.

In January 1987, NBC Radio's broadcast of [[Super Bowl XXI]] between the [[1986 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] and [[1986 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] was heard by a record 10.1 million people. Also in 1987, new three-year TV contracts with ABC, CBS, and NBC were announced for the [[1987 NFL season|1987]]–[[1989 NFL season|1989 seasons]] at the NFL's annual meeting in [[Maui, Hawaii]] on March 15.

During September of the [[1988 NFL season|1988 season]], NBC brought in some legendary broadcasters to fill-in for their regular play-by-play men. This was because, much of their key personnel (namely, [[Dick Enberg]], [[Marv Albert]], [[Don Criqui]], [[Charlie Jones (sportscaster)|Charlie Jones]], [[Tom Hammond]] as well as ''[[The NFL on NBC Pregame Show#NFL Live!|NFL Live!]]'' commentators [[Bob Costas]], [[Ahmad Rashad]], and [[Gayle Gardner]]) were away in [[Seoul, South Korea]] for [[Olympics on NBC|NBC's coverage]] of the [[1988 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]]. In the meantime, filling-in were names such as [[Curt Gowdy]], [[Ray Scott (sportscaster)|Ray Scott]], [[Chuck Thompson]], [[Marty Glickman]], [[Merle Harmon]] and [[Al DeRogatis]]. Bob Costas' predecessor, [[Len Berman]], filled-in for him at the anchor's desk while [[Gayle Sierens]] (who [[1987 NFL season|a year earlier]], made history by becoming the first female play-by-play announcer in NFL history) was also added to the studio team.

NBC's 1989 telecast of [[Super Bowl XXIII]] between the [[1988 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] and [[1988 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]] was watched by an estimated 110,780,000 viewers, according to A.C. Nielsen, making it the sixth most-watched program in television history.

Starting in [[1989 NFL season|1989]], NBC commissioned musician (and then-''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' co-host) [[John Tesh]], who had composed "[[Roundball Rock]]" for the debut of [[NBA on NBC|''The NBA on NBC'']] to compose a new theme, called "Gridiron Dreams" which lasted until 1991. The versions used on the pre-game show are different from the version supplied on Tesh's albums. For the 1992 season, John Colby composed a theme only used that year through the [[1992 AFC Championship Game]] in which the [[1992 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] beat the [[1992 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] 29-10.

*[[The Epic in Miami]]

*[[Freezer Bowl]]

*[[The Fumble]] – [[Dick Enberg]], the play-by-play announcer of the television broadcast on NBC, noted: "And wasn't it ironic that [[1987 Denver Broncos season|Denver]] got the ball back on the 2-yard-line?  Wasn't it just 1 year ago where the Broncos were on their own 2 before putting together what became '[[The Drive]]'?"

*[[Red Right 88]]

*[[Super Bowl XV]] – Super Bowl XV featured [[Dick Enberg]] handling the [[play-by-play]] duties and [[color commentator]]s [[Merlin Olsen]], [[John Brodie]], and [[Len Dawson]] (who wasn't in the broadcast booth with Enberg and Olsen). [[Bryant Gumbel]] and [[Mike Adamle]] of ''[[The NFL on NBC Pregame Show#The NFL .7Binsert year.7D .281977-1986.29|NFL '80]]'' anchored the pregame, halftime and postgame coverage.

*[[Super Bowl XVII]] – Super Bowl XVII featured [[Dick Enberg]] handling the [[play-by-play]] duties and [[color commentator]] [[Merlin Olsen]] in the broadcast booth. [[Len Berman]] and his ''[[The NFL on NBC Pregame Show#The NFL .7Binsert year.7D .281977-1986.29|NFL '82]]'' castmates, [[Mike Adamle]], [[Ahmad Rashad]] and [[Pete Axthelm]] anchored the pregame, halftime and postgame coverage. As previously mentioned, NBC's national [[Nielsen rating]] of 48.6 was the second-highest for a Super Bowl broadcast, trailing only the 49.1 garnered by [[Super Bowl XVI]] on [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] the year before. Following the game, NBC aired the premiere episode of ''[[The A-Team]]'', beginning the tradition of the game's host network airing programming after the game.

*[[Super Bowl XX]] – Super Bowl XX featured [[Play-by-play|play-by-play announcer]] [[Dick Enberg]] and [[color commentator]]s [[Merlin Olsen]] and [[Bob Griese]] (who was not in the booth with Enberg and Olsen). While Dick Enberg, Merlin Olsen and Bob Griese called the game, [[Bob Costas]] and his ''[[The NFL on NBC Pregame Show#The NFL .7Binsert year.7D .281977-1986.29|NFL '85]]'' castmates, [[Ahmad Rashad]] and [[Pete Axthelm]] anchored the pregame, halftime and postgame coverage. ''[[The Last Precinct]]'' debuted on [[NBC]] after the game.

*[[Super Bowl XXIII]] – Super Bowl XXIII featured [[Dick Enberg]] handling the [[play-by-play]] duties and [[color commentator]] [[Merlin Olsen]] in the broadcast booth. This would be Olsen's final Super Bowl broadcast, as he was demoted<ref>{{cite web |url=http://classicsportsmedia.blogspot.com/2013/02/history-of-1-analyst-demotions.html |title=History of #1 analyst demotions |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=18 February 2013 |work=Classic Sports TV and Media |publisher= |accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref> the following season to make room for Bill Walsh. [[Bob Costas]] along with [[Gayle Gardner]] hosted the pregame, halftime, and postgame coverage with analysts [[Paul Maguire]] and then-[[1988 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] head coach [[Don Shula]], pregame roving reporter [[Jim Gray (sportscaster)|Jim Gray]] (who was also working as a researcher for NBC Sports at the time) and [[Marv Albert]], who interviewed [[Boomer Esiason]] after the game. Meanwhile during NBC's pregame coverage, [[Ahmad Rashād]] and [[John Candy]] hosted the [[Diet Pepsi]] Talent Challenge at the [[Miami Seaquarium]]. Also, [[Frank Deford]] delivered a special segment profiling recently deceased [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] owner [[Art Rooney]]. This was also the first NFL game that NBC covered with their new "Quantel Cypher" graphics system, which was introduced during their coverage of the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Seoul Olympics]] (they had used Chyron for their graphics prior to Super Bowl XXIII). NBC also introduced their "cursive font" logo during this broadcast. Before, it was just the [[NBC logos#Current peacock logo .281986-present.29|1986 peacock logo]] with "NBC SPORTS" in their generic corporate font. With the win, the 49ers became the first team to win Super Bowls televised on three different networks ([[CBS]]-[[Super Bowl XVI|XVI]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-[[Super Bowl XIX|XIX]], and [[NBC]]). Since then, the [[1991 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] (in [[Super Bowl XXVI|1992]]), the [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] (in [[Super Bowl XXXI|1997]]), the [[2005 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] (in [[Super Bowl XL|2006]]) and the [[2007 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] (in [[Super Bowl XLII|2008]]) have accomplished this same feat. This was the last outdoor Super Bowl to start earlier than 6&nbsp;pm Eastern Standard Time, as it started just after 5&nbsp;pm. The movie ''[[Brotherhood of the Rose]]'' aired after the game.

===1990s===
On March 12, 1990, at the NFL's annual meeting in [[Orlando, Florida]], new four-year TV agreements were ratified for the [[1990 NFL season|1990]]–[[1993 NFL season|1993 seasons]]. The networks that were included were [[Monday Night Football|ABC]], [[NFL on CBS|CBS]], NBC, [[ESPN Sunday Night Football|ESPN]], and [[TNT Sunday Night Football|TNT]]. The contracts totaled US$3.6 billion, the largest in TV history. The television contract for [[1990 NFL season|1990]]–[[1993 NFL season|1993]] had each network having one Super Bowl telecast as part of the package. The fourth Super Bowl ([[Super Bowl XXVIII|XXVIII]]) was up for a separate sealed bid. NBC won the bid, and since they were last in the rotation for Super Bowl coverage in the regular contract, ended up with two straight Super Bowls (although they were originally scheduled to broadcast [[Super Bowl XXVI]]; CBS instead televised the game as part of a swap with the network). CBS is the only other network to televise two Super Bowls ([[Super Bowl I|I]] and [[Super Bowl II|II]]) in a row.

The live Sunday matches of the [[1991 Ryder Cup]] on [[Golf Channel on NBC|NBC]] were scheduled to end by mid-afternoon so that NBC could cover regional NFL games at 4 p.m. ET.

On December 18, 1993, the NFL announced new 4-year television agreements with ABC, ESPN, TNT, and NFL newcomer [[NFL on Fox|Fox]], which took over the NFC package from CBS. The NFL completed its new TV agreements by announcing that NBC would retain the rights to the AFC package on December 20.

Starting in 1995, NBC unveiled a new theme composed by veteran composer [[Randy Edelman]], which was used for both their pregame show (now simply titled ''The NFL on NBC'') and during the game.  This theme would be used until the end of the 1997 season, including [[Super Bowl XXXII]] between the [[1997 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] and [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]]. NBC lost AFC television rights after 1997 to CBS which currently has them today. The NFL would not return to NBC until [[2006 NFL season|2006]] for ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]''.  NBC still uses the 1995-1997 era theme, but only for ''Sunday Night Football'' online (dubbed '''''NBC Sunday Night Football Extra''''') if you open the feed prior to the game start time.

*[[The Comeback (American football)]] – [[1992 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo]]'s [[Ralph Wilson Stadium|Rich Stadium]] did not sell out for this game 72 hours in advance of the kickoff, and was therefore blacked out in [[Western New York]] and [[Southern Ontario]]. As a result, local fans did not get to see the game broadcast on TV.

*[[Super Bowl XXVII]] – Super Bowl XXVII featured [[Dick Enberg]] handling the [[play-by-play]] duties and [[color commentator]] [[Bob Trumpy]] in the broadcast booth. [[Bob Costas]] hosted all the events with analyst [[Mike Ditka]]. After the game, ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'' premiered on NBC.

*[[Super Bowl XXVIII]] – Super Bowl XXVIII featured [[play-by-play|play-by-play announcer]] [[Dick Enberg]] and [[color commentator]] [[Bob Trumpy]]. [[Jim Lampley]] hosted all the events with the help of analysts [[Mike Ditka]] and [[Joe Gibbs]] and sideline reporters [[O.J. Simpson]] (on Buffalo's sideline) and [[Will McDonough]] (on Dallas' sideline). It was the first time a network had held consecutive Super Bowls outright. As previously mentioned, the five-year NFL contract signed in 1989 had a provision where the last Super Bowl in the contract (XXVIII) would not be rotated, but would go to the highest bidder.  NBC, which had held XXVII (according the original rotation, NBC would have had XXVI and CBS XXVII, but the NFL allowed the networks to switch the two games in order to allow CBS a significant lead-in to its coverage of the [[1992 Winter Olympics]]), was the only network to bid on XXVIII. Previously, the league alternated the Super Bowl broadcast among its television networks, except for [[Super Bowl I]] in which both NBC and [[CBS]] televised it simultaneously. CBS broadcast [[Super Bowl II]], then the league rotated the broadcast between CBS and NBC until 1985 when [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] entered the rotation when they broadcast [[Super Bowl XIX]]. NBC aired the premiere of ''[[The John Larroquette Show]]'' following the game.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-post-super-bowl-tv-shows-pg,0,1116920.photogallery?index=16 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Best & Worst: Post-Super Bowl TV | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref>

*[[Super Bowl XXX]] – Super Bowl XXX featured [[play-by-play|play-by-play announcer]] [[Dick Enberg]] and [[color commentator]]s [[Phil Simms]] and [[Paul Maguire]]. [[Greg Gumbel]] hosted all the events with the help of then-NBC analysts [[Ahmad Rashad]], [[Mike Ditka]], [[Joe Gibbs]], and [[Joe Montana]]. All three Super Bowl wins for the Cowboys in the 1990s were broadcast on NBC. Following the game, NBC broadcast an [[The One After the Superbowl, Part One|hour-long episode]] of ''[[Friends]]'', restarting a trend in which the prized post-Super Bowl time slot was given to an established program. Previously, networks typically used the occasion to premiere a new show, with little success. Of the new series premiering after the Super Bowl from 1983–95, only ''[[The A-Team]]'' (NBC, after Super Bowl XVII), ''[[The Wonder Years]]'' (ABC, after XXII), and ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'' (NBC, after XXVII) had lengthy runs.

*[[Super Bowl XXXII]] – Super Bowl XXXII featured [[play-by-play|play-by-play announcer]] [[Dick Enberg]] and [[color commentator]]s [[Phil Simms]] and [[Paul Maguire]]. [[Greg Gumbel]] hosted all the events, and was joined by co-host [[Ahmad Rashad]] and commentators [[Cris Collinsworth]], [[Sam Wyche]], and [[Joe Gibbs]]. Following the game, NBC aired a special one-hour episode of ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]'', which opened live at the game site with Gumbel playing himself before he was "attacked" by show star [[John Lithgow]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Lead-In Show Drags Down A Good Game | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E3DC103BF935A15752C0A96E958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |work=The New York Times | date=January 26, 1998 | accessdate=February 24, 2008 | first=Richard | last=Sandomir}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E1DA113BF934A15752C0A96E958260&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss | title=Last Half-Hour Rang the Nielsen Bell |work=The New York Times | date=January 27, 1998 | accessdate=February 24, 2008 | first=Richard | last=Sandomir}}</ref> This broadcast was the last for NBC as the [[American Football Conference|AFC]] network after 33 years ([[CBS]] has held the AFC broadcast rights ever since), their last NFL broadcast overall until [[2006 NFL season|2006]], when they signed on to televise ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'', and their last Super Bowl broadcast until 2009 ([[Super Bowl XLIII]]).

====NBC loses to CBS====
NBC's rebound in their overall [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] in both the 1980s and 1990s (after years in the bottom of the ratings cellar) was attributed in part to its continuing coverage of the NFL. But with television contract re-negotiations in early 1998 ushering in the era of multi-billion dollar broadcasting agreements, an era of pro football broadcasting would soon come to an unceremonious conclusion.

[[NFL on CBS|CBS]], stung by [[NFL on Fox|Fox]]'s surprise bid [[1994 NFL season|four years earlier]], aggressively pursued NFL broadcast rights when the contract came up for renegotiation in 1997. CBS agreed to pay US$4 billion over eight years ($500 million per season) to take over NBC's AFC broadcast rights, which the network still holds today. NBC, meanwhile, had indicated a desire to bid for ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' rights in [[1998 NFL season|1998]], but eventually gave up and the rights were retained by ABC.

As previously mentioned, NBC's 33-year consecutive run as a football broadcaster came to an end with [[Super Bowl XXXII]], played on January 25, 1998 between the [[1997 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] and [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]]. The Broncos won 31–24 to snap the AFC's 13-year losing streak in the Super Bowl (since then, the AFC has won eight additional Super Bowls to the NFC's four).

===2000s===
After NBC lost its NFL rights to CBS at the end of the [[1997 NFL season|1997 season]], it in the process, marked the beginning of a slow decline for its sports division, culminating in the unproductive [[2004–05 United States network television schedule|2004–05 prime time season]] (despite heavy lineup promotion during the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]), when NBC carried no major sporting championships during prime time (NBC had already lost [[Major League Baseball on NBC|Major League Baseball]] broadcasting rights in 2000 and [[NBA on NBC|National Basketball Association]] rights in [[2001–02 NBA season|2002]]; they had acquired [[NHL on NBC|National Hockey League]] rights in 2004, but that league was in [[2004–05 NHL lockout|lockout]]).

NBC's attempts to replace the NFL with other professional football, including the [[XFL]] in 2001 and the [[AFL on NBC|Arena Football League coverage]] from [[2003 Arena Football League season|2003]] to [[2006 Arena Football League season|2006]], proved to be very unsuccessful. Like CBS before it, NBC would later decide that not having NFL rights did too much damage to its overall ratings to justify foregoing the high rights fees required.

In [[2005 NFL season|2005]], NBC reentered the NFL picture during negotiations. The network was able to take advantage of a league desire to be able to switch the schedule so non-competitive games would not air in the league's marquee timeslot. Since this would require a move to Sunday night in order to happen, and since ABC decided to relinquish their rights to ''Monday Night Football'', NBC was able to bid on the ''Sunday Night Football'' package and won the rights after ESPN (corporate sibling to ABC and who had previously held those rights) elected to take over the ''Monday Night Football'' rights instead. As previously mentioned, on Sunday, August 6, [[2006 NFL season|2006]], NBC resumed airing NFL football with coverage of the annual [[AFC-NFC Hall of Fame Game]].

NBC's rights package consists of everything that was previously in the ABC package; the Hall of Fame Game (as previously mentioned), one additional preseason game, the [[National Football League Kickoff game]], and two Saturday playoff games. NBC also received the rights to two Super Bowls in its bidding, [[Super Bowl XLIII]] and [[Super Bowl XLVI]] as well as the [[Pro Bowl]]s in each of those two years. ABC did not have the right to be flexible with their ''Monday Night Football'' schedule and picked matchups based on a team's record in the previous season (as NBC does), which often led to teams with losing records playing each other on Monday night later in the season. The moves were intended to break NBC out of its ratings slump; however, this didn't happen right away, and although ''NBC Sunday Night Football'' is the network's top rated program and in the top 30 for viewing audience, it had no affect on the rest of the network's schedule for several years.

[[Al Michaels]], the longtime voice of ''Monday Night Football'' and other events for ABC, is the play-by-play man for ''Sunday Night Football''. Michaels was originally slated to continue calling ''Monday Night Football'' for ESPN, but a trade was worked out between NBC and Disney, ABC and ESPN's parent company. In the trade, Michaels was able to join NBC in exchange for Disney acquiring from NBC's corporate sibling Universal Pictures, among other things, the rights to the cartoon character [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]], which was created at Universal by [[Walt Disney]] and [[Ub Iwerks]] before the founding of Disney's studio (and then given to [[Walter Lantz]], whose most famous creation would be [[Woody Woodpecker]]). [[Tom Hammond]] was NBC's secondary play-by-play man, calling one of NBC's two games on Wild Card Weekend.

[[John Madden]] (who had last worked with Al Michaels on ''Monday Night Football'' for ABC) was one of the first people hired by NBC, chosen to continue as a color analyst. [[Cris Collinsworth]] substituted for Madden when he was unavailable, called wild card games alongside Hammond until [[2008 NFL season|2008]], and took over on a permanent basis for the [[2009 NFL season|2009 season]] when Madden decided to retire from broadcasting. Prior to this he served as a studio analyst for ''[[Football Night in America]]'', NBC's pregame show. For the 2009 season, [[Joe Theismann]] and [[Joe Gibbs]] took Collinsworth's place in the booth for the first game of Wild Card Weekend. [[Andrea Kremer]] meanwhile, was the sideline reporter.

===2010s===
As of the [[2014 NFL season|2014 season]], ''Football Night in America'' is hosted by [[Bob Costas]], who hosts from the game site, with [[Dan Patrick]] emceeing from the [[Stamford, Connecticut]] studio. [[Tony Dungy]] and [[Rodney Harrison]] are studio analysts. ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' reporter [[Peter King (sportswriter)|Peter King]] serves as a feature reporter.  ''FNIA'' was broadcast from Studio 8G (and then from Studio 8H) from the GE (now Comcast) Building at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York from 2006-2013 before its own relocation to Stamford in September 2014, joining all of NBC Sports' other operations and [[NBCSN]].

The NFL also has a strict policy prohibiting networks to run ads during the Super Bowl from the gambling industry, and has rejected ads from the [[Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority]]. It had been reported that if the television program ''[[Las Vegas (TV series)|Las Vegas]]'' was still on the air when [[NBC]] televised [[Super Bowl XLIII]] in 2009, they likely would not have be allowed to promote the series during the entire block of programming.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2005-08-04-las-vegas-ads_x.htm | work=USA Today | first=Steve | last=Friess | title=NFL may ban 'Vegas' promos during games | date=August 4, 2005}}</ref> As ''Vegas'' ended during the 2007–2008 television season, this was no longer an issue for NBC.

With an average U.S. audience of 98.7 million viewers, Super Bowl XLIII was the most-watched Super Bowl in history, and at that point the second-most-watched U.S. television program of any kind (trailing only the [[Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen|final episode of ''M*A*S*H'']] in 1983; both would be broken by [[Super Bowl XLIV]] the following year). However, the [[Nielsen rating]] of 42.1, was lower than the 43.3 rating for the previous year's [[Super Bowl XLII|game]].

On December 14, 2011, the NFL, along with Fox, NBC and CBS, announced the league's rights deal with all three networks was extended to the end of the 2022 season. The three network rights deal includes the continued rotation of the Super Bowl yearly among the three, meaning NBC will air Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XLIX|XLIX]] (2015), [[Super Bowl LII|LII]] (2018), and LV (2021).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blog.chron.com/ultimatetexans/2011/12/nfl-extends-broadcast-agreements-through-2022-generating-billions/|title=NFL extends broadcast agreements through 2022, generating billions|last=Barron|first=David|date=December 14, 2011|work=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=December 19, 2011}}</ref> The new rights deal also includes NBC receiving the primetime game of the Thanksgiving tripleheader previously carried by NFL Network, along with a division playoff game and one wild card game rather than the full Wild Card Saturday package.

NBC's broadcast of [[Super Bowl XLVI]] at the end of the [[2011 NFL season|2011 season]] became the most-watched program in the history of [[Television in the United States|United States television]], with 111.3 million US viewers, according to [[Nielsen Company|Nielsen]].<ref>{{cite web|first=David |last=Bauder |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/06/super-bowl-ratings-record-tv-giants-patriots_n_1258107.html |title=Super Bowl Ratings Record: Giants-Patriots Game Is Highest-Rated TV Show In US History |work=Huffington Post |date=February 6, 2012 |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}</ref>

Sunday Night Football was the most watched program in the United States in the 2011-12 season and again in the 2013-14 season, in the latter case, NBC finished the season as the #1 network among 18-49 year olds for the first time since 2004 and #2 in overall viewers behind longtime leader CBS.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/ratings/2014/05/20/nbc-wins-the-2013-14-september-to-may-primetime-television-season-702212/20140520nbc04/ | title=NBC Wins the 2013-14 September-to-May Primetime Television Season | work=The Futon Critic | date=May 20, 2014 | accessdate=September 8, 2014}}</ref>

[[Play-by-play]] announcer [[Al Michaels]] and [[color commentator]] [[John Madden]] were in the booth, with [[Andrea Kremer]] and [[Alex Flanagan]] serving as [[sideline reporter]]s. The pre-game show – a record five hours long – was hosted by the ''[[Football Night in America]]'' team headed by [[Bob Costas]], and preceded by a two-hour special edition of ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' hosted by the regular weekday team live from Tampa and the [[NFL Films]] – produced ''Road to the Super Bowl''. [[Matt Millen]] was part of the coverage as a studio analyst. The'' Today'' contribution included portions of a taped interview with President Obama and pictures of troops viewing the proceedings in Iraq. John Madden was the first person to have announced a Super Bowl for each of the four major U.S. television networks, having called five Super Bowls for [[NFL on CBS|CBS]], three for [[NFL on Fox|Fox]], and two for [[Monday Night Football|ABC]] prior to joining NBC in [[2006 NFL season|2006]]. Meanwhile, Al Michaels was the third man to do play-by-play for a Super Bowl on NBC television (following in the footsteps of [[Curt Gowdy]] and [[Dick Enberg]]). Also, Michaels became the second person (after [[Pat Summerall]] on [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] and [[NFL on Fox|Fox]]) to be the lead Super Bowl play-by-play announcer for two different major U.S. networks ([[Monday Night Football|ABC]] and [[NBC Sunday Night Football|NBC]]). This would prove to be the final game Madden would call, as he announced his retirement from broadcasting on April 16, 2009. The Super Bowl was one of two major professional sports championship series [[NBC Sports|NBC]] broadcast in 2009, as they would also broadcast the [[2009 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]]. Both championship series involved teams from Pittsburgh winning championships.<ref name=StanleyCupFinals/> [[Mike Emrick]], [[Ed Olczyk]], and [[Pierre McGuire]] mentioned this when they called the Stanley Cup Finals.<ref name=StanleyCupFinals>{{cite video|title=[[NHL on NBC]]: Game 7 of the 2009 Stanley Cup Finals|medium=television|publisher=NBC Sports|date=June 12, 2009}} Emrick, Olczyk, and McGuire mentioned about Pittsburgh having two championships in the same year, as the [[Pittsburgh Penguins|Penguins]] won the Stanley Cup.</ref> Super Bowl XLIII was the final Super Bowl to air in the [[analog television]] format in the United States before the [[DTV transition in the United States|nationwide digital television transition]].

{{Main|Protestant Reformation|Counter-Reformation}}
{{See also|Christianity in the 15th century|Christianity in the 17th century}}
In '''16th-century Christianity''', [[Protestantism]] came to the forefront and marked a significant change in the [[Christianity|Christian]] world.

==Age of Discovery==
During the age of discovery the [[Roman Catholic Church]] established a number of [[Mission (Christian)|missions]] in the [[Americas]] and other colonies in order to spread Christianity in the [[New World]] and to convert the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]]. At the same time, missionaries such as [[Francis Xavier]] as well as other [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], [[Augustinians]], [[Franciscans]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] were moving into [[Asia]] and the [[Far East]]. Under the [[Padroado]] treaty with the [[Holy See]], by which the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] delegated to the kings the administration of the local churches, the [[History of Portugal (1415–1578)|Portuguese sent missions]] into [[Africa]], [[Brasil]] and Asia. While some of these missions were associated with [[imperialism]] and oppression, others (notably [[Matteo Ricci]]'s [[Jesuit China missions]]) were relatively peaceful and focused on integration rather than [[cultural imperialism]].

The expansion of the Catholic [[Portuguese Empire]] and [[Spanish Empire]] with a significant role played by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] led to the [[Christianization]] of the indigenous populations of the Americas such as the [[Aztec]]s and [[Inca]]s. Later waves of colonial expansion such as the [[Scramble for Africa]] or the [[European colonies in India|struggle for India]] by the [[Netherlands]], [[England]], [[France]], [[Germany]] and [[Russia]] led to Christianization of other native populations across the globe, eclipsing that of the Roman period and making it a truly global religion.

==Protestant Reformation==
The [[Renaissance]] yielded scholars the ability to read the scriptures in their original languages, and this in part stimulated the [[Protestant Reformation]]. [[Martin Luther]], a ''Doctor in Bible'' at the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Wittenberg]],<ref name=Brecht12>Brecht, Martin. ''Martin Luther''. tr. James L. Schaaf, Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985–93, 1:12-27.</ref> began to teach that [[salvation]] is a gift of God's [[Sola gratia|grace]], attainable only through [[sola fide|faith]] in [[Jesus]], who [[Theology of the Cross|in humility]] paid for sin.<ref name=Wriedt>Wriedt, Markus. "Luther's Theology", in ''The Cambridge Companion to Luther''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2003, pp.88–94.</ref> Along with the doctrine of justification, the Reformation promoted a higher view of the [[Bible]]. As Martin Luther said, "The true rule is this: God's Word shall establish articles of faith, and no one else, not even an angel can do so."<ref>Martin Luther, [[Smalcald Articles]] II, 15.</ref> These two ideas in turn promoted the concept of the [[priesthood of all believers]]. Other important reformers were [[John Calvin]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon]], [[Martin Bucer]] and the [[Anabaptist]]s.

These reformers are distinguished from previous ones in that they considered the root of corruptions to be doctrinal (rather than simply a matter of moral weakness or lack of ecclesiastical discipline), and thus they aimed to change contemporary doctrines to accord with what they perceived to be the "true gospel." The word ''Protestant'' is derived from the Latin ''protestatio'' meaning ''declaration'' which refers to the [[Protestation at Speyer|letter of protestation]] by Lutheran princes against the decision of the [[Second Diet of Speyer|Diet of Speyer]] in 1529, which reaffirmed the edict of the [[Diet of Worms]] against the Reformation.<ref name="TECGlossary">[http://www.episcopalchurch.org/19625_15125_ENG_HTM.htm Definition of Protestantism at the Episcopal Church website]</ref> Since that time, the term has been used in many different senses, but most often as a general term refers to [[Western Christianity]] that is not subject to papal authority.<ref name="TECGlossary" /> The term "Protestant" was not originally used by Reformation era  leaders; instead, they called themselves "evangelical", emphasising the "return to the true gospel (Greek: ''euangelion'')."<ref>MacCulloch, p.xx</ref>

The beginning of the Protestant Reformation is generally identified with [[Martin Luther]] and the posting of the [[The 95 Theses|95 Theses]] on the castle church in [[Wittenberg]], Germany. Early protest was against corruptions such as [[simony]], episcopal vacancies, and the sale of [[indulgence]]s. The three most important traditions to emerge directly from the Protestant Reformation were the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] ([[Calvinist]], [[Presbyterian]], etc.), and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] traditions, though the latter group identifies as both "Reformed" and "Catholic", and some subgroups reject the classification as "Protestant."

The Protestant Reformation may be divided into two distinct but basically simultaneous movements, the [[Magisterial Reformation]] and the [[Radical Reformation]]. The Magisterial Reformation involved the alliance of certain theological teachers (Latin: ''magistri'') such as Luther, Zwingli, Calvin, and Cranmer, with secular magistrates who cooperated in the reformation of Christendom. Radical Reformers, besides forming communities outside state sanction, often employed more extreme doctrinal change, such as the rejection of tenets of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Councils of Nicaea]] and [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]]. Often the division between magisterial and radical reformers was as or more violent than the general Catholic and Protestant hostilities.

The Protestant Reformation spread almost entirely within the confines of [[Northern Europe]] but did not take hold in certain northern areas such as [[Ireland]] and parts of Germany. The Catholic response to the Protestant Reformation is known as the [[Counter-Reformation]] which resulted in a reassertion of traditional doctrines and the emergence of new religious orders aimed at both moral reform and new missionary activity. The Counter-Reformation reconverted approximately 33% of Northern Europe to [[Catholicism]] and initiated missions in [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]], Africa, Asia, and even [[China]] and [[Japan]]. Protestant expansion outside of Europe occurred on a smaller scale through [[European colonization of the Americas|colonization of North America]] and [[Colonisation of Africa|areas of Africa]].

===Martin Luther and Lutheranism===
[[Image:95Thesen.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Luther's 95 Theses]]
The protests against Rome began in earnest in 1517 when Martin Luther, an [[Augustinian]] monk, called for a reopening of the debate on the sale of [[indulgence]]s.  Luther's dissent marked a sudden outbreak of a new and irresistible force of discontent which had been pushed underground but not resolved. The quick spread of discontent occurred to a large degree because of the [[printing press]] and the resulting swift movement of both ideas and documents, including the ''[[95 Theses]]''.  Information was also widely disseminated in manuscript form, as well as by cheap prints and [[woodcut]]s amongst the poorer sections of society.

Parallel to events in Germany was a movement began in [[Switzerland]] under the leadership of [[Ulrich Zwingli]]. These two movements quickly agreed on most issues, but some unresolved differences kept them separate. Some followers of Zwingli believed that the Reformation was too conservative and moved independently toward more radical positions, some of which survive among modern day Anabaptists. Other Protestant movements grew up along lines of [[mysticism]] or [[humanism]], sometimes breaking from Rome or from the Protestants, or forming outside of the churches.

After this first stage of the Reformation, following the [[excommunication]] of Luther and condemnation of the Reformation by the pope, the work and writings of [[John Calvin]] were influential in establishing a loose consensus among various groups in Switzerland, [[Scotland]], Hungary, Germany and elsewhere.

[[Image:Martin_Luther,_1529.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Martin Luther, by Lucas Cranach the Elder]]
As Luther began developing his own theology, he increasingly came into conflict with [[Thomism|Thomistic]] scholars, most notably [[Thomas Cajetan|Cardinal Cajetan]].<ref>MacCulloch, pp. 124–125</ref> Soon, Luther had begun to develop his theology of [[Justification (theology)|justification]], or process by which one is "made right" (righteous) in the eyes of God. In Catholic theology, one is made righteous by a progressive infusion of grace accepted through faith and cooperated with through good works. Luther's doctrine of justification differed from Catholic theology in that justification rather meant "the declaring of one to be righteous", where God imputes the merits of Christ upon one who remains without inherent merit.<ref>MacCulloch, p.119</ref> In this process, good works are more of an unessential byproduct that contribute nothing to one's own state of righteousness. Conflict between Luther and leading theologians led to his gradual rejection of authority of the Church hierarchy. In 1520, he was condemned for heresy by the papal bull ''[[Exsurge Domine]]'', which he burned at Wittenberg along with books of [[canon law]].<ref>MacCulloch, p.128</ref>

Luther's refusal to retract his writings in confrontation with the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]] at the [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521 resulted in his [[excommunication]] by [[Pope Leo X]] and declaration as an [[outlaw]]. His [[Luther Bible|translation of the Bible]] into the language of the people made the Scriptures more accessible, causing a tremendous impact on the church and on German culture. It fostered the development of a standard version of the [[German language]], added several principles to the art of translation,<ref>Fahlbusch, Erwin and Bromiley, Geoffrey William. ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity''. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Leiden, Netherlands: Wm. B. Eerdmans; Brill, 1999–2003, 1:244.</ref> and influenced the translation of the [[King James Bible]].<ref name="Tyndale">''Tyndale's New Testament'', trans. from the Greek by William Tyndale in 1534 in a modern-spelling edition and with an introduction by David Daniell''. New Haven, Connecticut: [[Yale University]] Press, 1989, ix–x.</ref> His [[hymn]]s inspired the development of congregational singing within Christianity.<ref name=Bainton269>Bainton, p.269</ref> His marriage to [[Katharina von Bora]] set a model for the practice of [[clerical marriage]] within Protestantism.<ref>Bainton, p.223.</ref>

Luther's insights are generally held to have been a major foundation of the [[Protestantism|Protestant movement]]. The relationship between Lutheranism and the Protestant tradition is, however, ambiguous:  some Lutherans consider Lutheranism to be outside the Protestant tradition, while some see it as part of this tradition.<ref>"Protestant?" <cite>The Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod</cite> [http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=4409 (Website FAQ)]</ref>

[[Image:Tesentür WB.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Door of the ''Schlosskirche'' (castle church) in Wittenberg to which Luther is said to have nailed his [[95 Theses]], sparking the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].]]

====Widening breach====
Luther's writings circulated widely, reaching France, England, and Italy as early as 1519, and students thronged to Wittenberg to hear him speak. He published a short commentary on [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] and his ''Work on the Psalms''. At the same time, he received deputations from Italy and from the [[Utraquist]]s of Bohemia; [[Ulrich von Hutten]] and [[Franz von Sickingen]] offered to place Luther under their protection.<!--we need to say why he needed protection--><ref name="Herzog71">Macauley Jackson, Samuel and Gilmore, George William. (eds.) [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc07/Page_71.html "Martin Luther"], ''The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge'', New York, London, Funk and Wagnalls Co., 1908–1914; Grand Rapids, Michigan: Baker Book House, 1951), 71.</ref>

This early portion of Luther's career was one of his most creative and productive.<ref>Spitz, Lewis W. ''The Renaissance and Reformation Movements'', St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1987, 338.</ref> Three of his best known works were published in 1520: ''[[To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation]]'', ''[[On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church]]'', and ''[[On the Freedom of a Christian]]''.

Finally on 30 May 1519, when the pope demanded an explanation, Luther wrote a summary and explanation of his theses to the pope. While the pope may have conceded some of the points, he did not like the challenge to his authority so he summoned Luther to Rome to answer these. At that point [[Frederick the Wise]], the Saxon Elector, intervened. He did not want one of his subjects to be sent to Rome to be judged by the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic clergy]] so he prevailed on [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] to arrange a compromise.

An arrangement was effected, however, whereby that summons was cancelled, and Luther went to Augsburg in October 1518 to meet the papal legate, Cardinal [[Thomas Cajetan]]. The argument was long, but nothing was resolved.[[Image:BullExurgeDomine.jpg|thumb|upright|First edition of ''Exsurge Domine''.]]

====Political maneuvering====
What had started as a strictly theological and academic debate had now turned into something of a social and political conflict as well, pitting Luther, his German allies and Northern European supporters against [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], France, the Italian pope, their territories and other allies. The conflict would erupt into a religious war after Luther's death, fueled by the political climate of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and strong personalities on both sides.

In 1526, at the [[First Diet of Speyer]], it was decided that until a [[General council (Christianity)|General Council]] could meet and settle the theological issues raised by Martin Luther, the [[Edict of Worms]] would not be enforced, and each prince could decide if Lutheran teachings and worship would be allowed in his territories. In 1529, at the [[Second Diet of Speyer]], the decision the previous Diet of Speyer was reversed — despite the strong protests of the Lutheran princes, free cities and some [[Zwinglian]] territories. These states quickly became known as Protestants. At first, this term ''Protestant'' was used politically for the states that resisted the Edict of Worms. Over time, however, this term came to be used for the religious movements that opposed the Roman Catholic tradition in the 16th century.

Lutheranism would become known as a separate movement after the 1530 [[Diet of Augsburg]], which was convened by Charles V to try to stop the growing Protestant movement. At the Diet, [[Philipp Melanchthon]] presented a written summary of Lutheran beliefs called the [[Augsburg Confession]].  Several of the German princes (and later, kings and princes of other countries) signed the document to define "Lutheran" territories.  These princes allied to create the [[Schmalkaldic League]] in 1531, which led to the [[Schmalkald War]] in 1547 that pitted the Lutheran princes of the Schmalkaldic League against the Catholic forces of Charles V.

After the conclusion of the Schmalkald War, Charles V attempted to impose Catholic religious doctrine on the territories that he had defeated. However, the Lutheran movement was far from defeated. In 1577, the next generation of Lutheran theologians gathered the work of the previous generation to define the doctrine of the persisting Lutheran church. This document is known as the [[Formula of Concord]]. In 1580, it was published with the Augsburg Confession, the [[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]], the [[Luther's Large Catechism|Large]] and [[Luther's Small Catechism|Small Catechisms]] of Martin Luther, the [[Smalcald Articles]] and the [[Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope]]. Together they were distributed in a volume entitled ''[[The Book of Concord]]''.

====Results of the Lutheran Reformation====
Luther and his followers began a large exodus from the Roman Catholic Church known as the Protestant Reformation. Large numbers of Europeans left the Roman Church, including the majority of [[German language|German speakers]] (the only German speaking areas where the population remained mostly in the Catholic Church were those under the domain or influence of Catholic Austria and Bavaria or the electoral archbishops of Mainz, Cologne, and Trier). Because Luther sparked this mass movement, he is known as the father of the Protestant Reformation, and the father of Protestantism in general.

===Calvinism===
[[Calvinism]] is a system of [[Christian theology]] and an approach to Christian life and thought within the [[Protestant Christianity|Protestant tradition]] articulated by [[John Calvin]] and subsequently by successors, associates, followers and admirers of Calvin and his interpretation of [[Christian Bible|Scripture]], and perspective on Christian life and theology. Calvin's [[Theology of John Calvin|system of theology]] and Christian life forms the basis of the '''Reformed tradition''', a term roughly equivalent to ''Calvinism''.

The Reformed tradition was originally advanced by stalwarts such as [[Martin Bucer]], [[Heinrich Bullinger]] and [[Peter Martyr Vermigli]], and also influenced English reformers such as [[Thomas Cranmer]] and [[John Jewel]]. However, because of Calvin's great influence and role in the confessional and ecclesiastical debates throughout the 17th century, this Reformed movement generally became known as Calvinism. Today, this term also refers to the doctrines and practices of the [[Reformed churches]], of which Calvin was an early leader, and the system is perhaps best known for its doctrines of ''[[Predestination (Calvinism)|predestination]]'' and ''[[Unconditional election|election]]''.

The Reformation foundations engaged with [[Augustinians|Augustinianism]]. Both Luther and Calvin thought along lines linked with the theological teachings of [[Augustine of Hippo]]. The Augustinianism of the Reformers struggled against [[Pelagianism]], a heresy that they perceived in the Catholic Church of their day.  In the course of this religious upheaval, the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1524&ndash;1525 swept through the [[Bavaria]]n, [[Thuringia]]n and [[Swabia]]n principalities, leaving scores of Catholics slaughtered at the hands of Protestant bands, including the [[Black Company]] of [[Florian Geier]],a knight from [[Giebelstadt]] who joined the peasants in the general outrage against the Catholic hierarchy.

====Ulrich Zwingli====
[[Image:Ulrich Zwingli.jpg|thumb|left|Ulrich Zwingli, wearing the scholar's cap.]]
Ulrich Zwingli was a Swiss scholar and parish priest who was likewise influential in the beginnings of the Protestant Reformation. Zwingli claimed that his theology owed nothing to Luther and that he had developed it in 1516, before Luther's famous protest, though his doctrine of justification was remarkably similar to that of Luther.<ref>MacCulloch, pp.137–138</ref> In 1518, Zwingli was given a post at the wealthy collegiate church of the [[Grossmünster]] in [[Zürich]], where he remained until his death. Soon he had risen to prominence in the city. Zwingli began preaching his version of reform, with certain points as the aforementioned doctrine of justification, but others (with which Luther vehemently disagreed) such as the position that veneration of icons was actually idolatry and thus a violation of the [[Ten Commandments|first commandment]], and the denial of the [[real presence]] in the [[Eucharist]].<ref>MacCulloch, Diarmaid, pp.146–148</ref> Soon the city council had accepted Zwingli's doctrines, and Zürich became a focal point of more radical reforming movements. Followers of Zwingli pushed his message and reforms far further than even he had intended, such as rejecting infant baptism.<ref>MacCulloch, pp.148–149</ref> This split between Luther and Zwingli formed the essence of the Protestant division between Lutheran and Reformed theology. Meanwhile, political tensions increased; Zwingli and the Zürich leadership imposed an economic blockade on the inner Catholic states of Switzerland, which led to a battle in which Zwingli, in full armor, was slain along with his troops.

====John Calvin====
John Calvin was a French cleric and doctor of law. He belonged to the second generation of the Reformation, publishing his theological tome, the ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'', in 1536 (later revised) and establishing himself as a leader of the Reformed church in [[Geneva]], which became an "unofficial capital" of Reformed Christianity in the second half of the 16th century. He exerted a remarkable amount of authority in the city and over the city council, such that he has (rather ignominiously) been called a "Protestant pope." Calvin established an eldership together with a [[Consistory (Protestantism)#Reformed usage|consistory]], where pastors and the elders established matters of religious discipline for the Genevan population.<ref>MacCulloch, p.238</ref> Calvin's theology is best known for his doctrine of [[Predestination (Calvinism)|(double) predestination]], which held that God had, from all eternity, [[Divine Providence|providentially]] foreordained who would be saved ([[unconditional election|the elect]]) and likewise who would be damned ([[reprobation|the reprobate]]). Predestination was not the dominant idea in Calvin's works, but it would seemingly become so for many of his Reformed successors.<ref>MacCulloch, p.243</ref>

Following the excommunication of Luther and condemnation of the Reformation by the pope, the work and writings of Calvin were influential in establishing a loose consensus among various groups in Switzerland, [[Scotland]], Hungary, Germany and elsewhere.
Geneva became the unofficial capital of the Protestant movement, led by the Frenchman, [[Jean Calvin]], until his death when Calvin's ally, Zwingli, assumed the spiritual leadership of the group.

===Arminianism===
[[Arminianism]] is a school of [[Soteriology|soteriological]] thought in Protestant [[Christian theology]] founded by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]]. Its acceptance stretches through much of mainstream Protestantism. Because of the influence of [[John Wesley]], Arminianism is perhaps most prominent in the [[Methodism|Methodist movement]].

Arminianism holds to the following tenets:
* Humans are naturally [[Total depravity|unable]] to make any effort towards salvation
* Salvation is possible by [[Sola gratia|grace alone]]
* Works of human effort cannot cause or contribute to [[salvation]]
* God's [[Conditional election|election is conditional]] on faith in Jesus
* Jesus' [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] was potentially for [[Unlimited atonement|all people]]
* God allows his [[Prevenient grace|grace]] to be resisted by those unwilling to believe
* Salvation can be lost, as continued salvation is [[Conditional preservation of the saints|conditional upon continued faith]]

Arminianism is most accurately used to define those who affirm the original beliefs of Jacobus Arminius, but the term can also be understood as an umbrella for a larger grouping of ideas including those of [[Hugo Grotius]], [[John Wesley]], [[Clark Pinnock]], and others. There are two primary perspectives on how the system is applied in detail: Classical Arminianism, which sees Arminius as its figurehead, and Wesleyan Arminianism, which (as the name suggests) sees John Wesley as its figurehead. Wesleyan Arminianism is sometimes synonymous with Methodism.

Within the broad scope of [[History of Christianity|church history]], Arminianism is closely related to Calvinism, and the two systems share both history and many doctrines. Nonetheless, they are often viewed as archrivals within Evangelicalism because of their disagreement over the doctrines of [[predestination]] and [[salvation]].

=== Anglicanism and the English Reformation ===
[[Image:Hooker-Statue.jpeg|thumb|150px|Statue of [[Richard Hooker]], whose  emphases on reason, tolerance and inclusiveness influenced [[Anglicanism]].]]
Anglican doctrine emerged from the interweaving of two main strands of Christian doctrine during the [[English Reformation]] in the 16th and 17th centuries.  The first strand is the Catholic doctrine taught by the established church in England in the early 16th century.  The second strand is a range of Protestant Reformed teachings brought to England from neighbouring countries in the same period, notably Calvinism and Lutheranism.

The [[Church of England]] was the national branch of the Catholic Church. The formal doctrines had been documented in [[canon law]] over the centuries, and the Church of England still follows an unbroken tradition of canon law. The English Reformation did not dispense of all previous doctrines.  The church not only retained the core Catholic beliefs common to [[Reformed]] doctrine in general, such as the [[Trinity]], the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|Virgin Birth]] of Jesus, the nature of Jesus as fully human and fully God, the [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection of Jesus]], [[Original Sin]], and [[Excommunication]] (as affirmed by the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]]), but also retained some Catholic teachings which were rejected by true Protestants, such as the [[Anglican ministry|three orders of ministry]] and the [[apostolic succession]] of bishops.

Unlike other reform movements, the English Reformation began by royal influence. [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] considered himself a thoroughly Catholic king, and in 1521 he defended the papacy against Luther in a book he commissioned entitled, ''[[Defence of the Seven Sacraments|The Defence of the Seven Sacraments]]'', for which [[Leo X|Pope Leo X]] awarded him the title ''[[Fidei Defensor]]'' (Defender of the Faith). However, the king came into conflict with the papacy when he wished to annul his marriage with [[Catherine of Aragon]], for which he needed papal sanction. Catherine, among many other noble relations, was the aunt of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], the papacy's most significant secular supporter. The ensuing dispute eventually led to a break from Rome. In 1534, the [[Act of Supremacy]] made Henry the [[Supreme Head]] of the Church of England. Between 1535 and 1540, under [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]], the policy known as the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] was put into effect.

There were some notable opponents to the [[Henrician Reformation]], such as [[Thomas More]] and Bishop [[John Fisher]], who were executed for their opposition. There was also a growing party of reformers who were imbued with the Zwinglian and Calvinistic doctrines. When Henry died he was succeeded by his Protestant son [[Edward VI]], who, through his empowered councillors (with the king being only nine years old at his succession and not yet sixteen at his death) the Duke of Somerset and the Duke of Northumberland, ordered the destruction of images in churches, and the closing of the [[chantry|chantries]]. Under Edward VI the reform of the Church of England was established unequivocally in doctrinal terms. Yet, at a popular level, religion in England was still in a state of flux. Following a brief Roman Catholic restoration during the reign of [[Mary I of England|Mary]] 1553&ndash;1558, a loose consensus developed during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], though this point is one of considerable debate among historians. Yet it is the so-called "[[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]]" to which the origins of [[Anglicanism]] are traditionally ascribed.

The political separation of the Church of England from Rome, beginning in 1529 and completed in 1536, brought England alongside this broad Reformed movement. However, religious changes in the English national church proceeded more conservatively than elsewhere in Europe.  Reformers in the Church of England alternated for centuries between sympathies for Catholic traditions and Protestantism, progressively forging a stable compromise between adherence to ancient tradition and Protestantism, which is now sometimes called the [[via media]].<ref>What emerged was a state church that considered itself both "Reformed" and "Catholic" but not "Roman" (and hesitated from the title "Protestant"), and other "unofficial" more radical movements such as the [[Puritan]]s.[http://www.umbc.edu/history/CHE/techerpages/Eppard/teachernotes.html The Sacking of Rome & The English Reformation]</ref>

[[Image:Darnley stage 3.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], Queen  of England and Ireland.]]

===Monasticism===
During the Reformation the teachings of Martin Luther led to the end of the monasteries, but a few Protestants followed [[monasticism|monastic]] lives. [[Loccum Abbey]] and [[Amelungsborn Abbey]] have the longest traditions as Lutheran monasteries.
Since the 19th century there have been a renewal in the monastic life among Protestants.

Monastic life in England came to an abrupt end with [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]. The property and lands of the [[monastery|monasteries]] were confiscated and either retained by the king or given to loyal [[protestant]] [[nobility]]. [[Monk]]s and [[nun]]s were forced to either flee for the continent or to abandon their vocations. For around 300 years, there were no monastic communities within any of the [[Anglican]] churches.

=== Scandinavia ===
All of [[Scandinavia]] ultimately adopted Lutheranism over the course of the 16th century, as the monarchs of Denmark (who also ruled [[Norway]] and [[Iceland]]) and [[Sweden]] (who also ruled [[Finland]]) converted to that faith.

In Sweden the Reformation was spearheaded by [[Gustav Vasa]], elected king in 1523. Friction with the pope over interference in Swedish ecclesiastical affairs led to the discontinuance of any official connection between Sweden and the papacy from 1523.<ref name="Gilbert-12">[http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/gilbert/12.html Chapter 12 The Reformation In Germany And Scandinavia], Renaissance and Reformation by William Gilbert.</ref> Four years later, at the Diet of Västerås, the king succeeded in forcing the diet to accept his dominion over the national church. The king was given possession of all church property, church appointments required royal approval, the clergy were subject to the civil law, and the "pure Word of God" was to be preached in the churches and taught in the schools&mdash;effectively granting official sanction to Lutheran ideas.<ref name="Gilbert-12"/>

Under the reign of [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederick I]] (1523&ndash;33), Denmark remained officially Catholic. But though Frederick initially pledged to persecute Lutherans, he soon adopted a policy of protecting Lutheran preachers and reformers, of whom the most famous was [[Hans Tausen]].<ref name="Gilbert-12"/> During his reign, Lutheranism made significant inroads among the Danish population. Frederick's son, Christian, was openly Lutheran, which prevented his election to the throne upon his father's death. However, following his victory in the civil war that followed, in 1537 he became [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]] and began a [[Reformation in Denmark|reformation of the official state church]].

=== Scotland ===
The [[Scottish Reformation]] culminated ecclesiastically in the re-establishment of the church along [[Reformed theology|Reformed]] lines, and politically in the triumph of English influence over that of France. [[John Knox]] is regarded as the leader of the Scottish Reformation

The [[Scottish Reformation Parliament|Reformation Parliament]] of 1560, which repudiated the pope's authority, forbade the celebration of the [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] and approved a Protestant [[Confession of Faith]]. This was made possible by a revolution against French hegemony under the regime of the [[regent]] [[Mary of Guise]], who had governed Scotland in the name of her absent daughter [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] (then also [[Queen consort|Queen]] of France).
The Scottish Reformation decisively shaped the [[Church of Scotland]]<ref>Article 1, of the [[Articles Declaratory of the Constitution of the Church of Scotland]] 1921 states 'The Church of Scotland adheres to the Scottish Reformation'.</ref> and, through it, all other [[Presbyterian]] churches worldwide.

A spiritual revival also broke out among Catholics soon after Martin Luther's actions, and led to the [[Covenanter|Scottish Covenanters' movement]], the precursor to [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Presbyterianism]].  This movement spread, and greatly influenced the formation of [[Puritanism]] among the [[Anglican Church]] in England.  The Scottish Covenanters were persecuted by the Roman Catholic Church.  This persecution by the Catholics drove some of the Protestant Covenanter leadership out of Scotland and into France and Switzerland.

=== France ===
Protestantism also spread into France, where the Protestants were nicknamed "[[Huguenots]]", and this touched off decades of warfare in France, after initial support by [[Henry of Navarre]] was lost with the "[[Affair of the placards|Night of the Placards]]" affair. Many French Huguenots however, still contributed to the Protestant movement, including many who emigrated to the English colonies.
[[Image:Francois Dubois 001.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Bartholomew]]'s Day massacre, Painting by [[François Dubois]] (born about 1529, Amiens, Picardy)]]
Though he was not personally interested in religious reform, [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] initially maintained an attitude of tolerance, arising from his interest in the [[humanism|humanist]] movement. This changed in 1534 with the Affair of the Placards. In this act, Protestants denounced the mass in placards that appeared across France, even reaching the royal apartments. The issue of religious faith having been thrown into the arena of politics, Francis was prompted to view the movement as a threat to the kingdom's stability. This led to the first major phase of anti-Protestant persecution in France, in which the ''[[Chambre Ardente]]'' ("Burning Chamber") was established within the [[Parlement of Paris]] to handle the rise in prosecutions for heresy. Several thousand French Protestants fled the country during this time, most notably John Calvin, who settled in [[Geneva]].

Calvin continued to take an interest in the religious affairs of his native land and, from his base in Geneva, beyond the reach of the French king, regularly trained pastors to lead congregations in France. Despite heavy persecution by [[Henry II of France|Henry II]], the [[Reformed Church of France]], largely Calvinist in direction, made steady progress across large sections of the nation, in the urban [[bourgeoisie]] and parts of the [[aristocracy]], appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment.

French Protestantism, though its appeal increased under persecution, came to acquire a distinctly political character, made all the more obvious by the noble conversions of the 1550s.  This had the effect of creating the preconditions for a series of destructive and intermittent conflicts, known as the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]].  The civil wars were helped along by the sudden death of Henry II in 1559, which saw the beginning of a prolonged period of weakness for the French crown. [[Wiktionary:atrocity|Atrocity]] and outrage became the defining characteristic of the time, illustrated at its most intense in the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of August 1572, when the Catholic Church annihilated between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France.<ref>[http://home.eckerd.edu/~oberhot/paris-siege-stbarth.htm Paris and the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre: August 24, 1572]</ref>  The wars only concluded when [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], a former Huguenot, issued the [[Edict of Nantes]], promising official toleration of the Protestant minority but under highly restricted conditions. Catholicism remained the official state religion, and the fortunes of French Protestants gradually declined over the next century, culminating in Louis XIV's [[Edict of Fontainebleau]]&mdash;which revoked the Edict of Nantes and made Catholicism the sole legal religion of France. In response to the Edict of Fontainebleau, [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]] of [[Brandenburg]] declared the [[Edict of Potsdam]], giving free passage to French Huguenot refugees and tax-free status to them for 10 years.

=== Netherlands ===
{{Main|History of religion in the Netherlands}}
[[Image:Dirck van Delen - Beeldenstorm in een kerk.jpg|thumb|[[Iconoclasm]]: The organised destruction of Catholic images, or ''Beeldenstorm'', swept through Netherlands churches in 1566.]]
The Reformation in the Netherlands, unlike in many other countries, was not initiated by the rulers of the [[Seventeen Provinces]] but instead by multiple popular movements, which in turn were bolstered by the arrival of Protestant refugees from other parts of the continent. While the Anabaptist movement enjoyed popularity in the region in the early decades of the Reformation, Calvinism, in the form of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], became the dominant Protestant faith in the country from the 1560s onward.

Harsh persecution of Protestants by the Spanish government of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] contributed to a desire for independence in the provinces, which led to the [[Eighty Years' War]] and eventually, the separation of the largely Protestant [[Dutch Republic]] from the Catholic-dominated [[Southern Netherlands]], the present-day Belgium.

=== Hungary ===
Much of the population of [[Kingdom of Hungary]] adopted Protestantism during the 16th century. The spread of Protestantism in the country was aided by its large ethnic German minority, which could understand and translate the [[Martin Luther (resources)|writings of Martin Luther]]. While Lutheranism gained a foothold among the German-speaking population, Calvinism became widely accepted among ethnic Hungarians.<ref>Revesz, Imre, History of the Hungarian Reformed Church, Knight, George A.F. ed., [[Hungarian Reformed Federation of America]] (Washington, D.C.: 1956).</ref>

In the more independent northwest the rulers and priests, protected by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] which had taken the field to fight the Turks, defended the old Catholic faith. They dragged the Protestants to prison and the stake wherever they could.

Protestants likely formed a majority of Hungary's population at the close of the 16th century, but Counter-Reformation efforts in the 17th century reconverted a majority of the kingdom to Catholicism.<ref>[http://www.eldrbarry.net/heidel/eeurorsc.htm The Forgotten Reformations in Eastern Europe]</ref> A significant Protestant minority remained, most of it adhering to the Calvinist faith.

==Counter-Reformation==
The Counter-Reformation, or Catholic Reformation, was the response of the Catholic Church to the Protestant Reformation. The essence of the Counter-Reformation was a renewed conviction in traditional practices and the upholding of Catholic doctrine as the source of ecclesiastic and moral reform, and the answer to halting the spread of Protestantism. Thus it experienced the founding of new religious orders, such as the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], the establishment of [[seminaries]] for the proper training of priests, renewed worldwide missionary activity, and the development of new yet orthodox forms of spirituality, such as that of the [[Spanish mystics]] and the [[French school of spirituality]]. The entire process was spearheaded by the [[Council of Trent]], which clarified and reasserted doctrine, issued dogmatic definitions, and produced the ''[[Roman Catechism]]''.

The counter-reformation and developed a [[Second scholasticism]], which was pitted against [[Lutheran scholasticism]]. The overall result of the Reformation was therefore to highlight distinctions of belief that had previously co-existed uneasily.

Though Ireland, Spain, and France featured significantly in the Counter-Reformation, its heart was Italy and the various popes of the time, who established the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'', (the list of prohibited books) or simply the "Index," and the [[Roman Inquisition]], a system of juridical tribunals that prosecuted heresy and related offences.  The Papacy of [[Pope Pius V|St. Pius V]] (1566–1572) was known for its focus on halting heresy and worldly abuses within the Church and for its focus on improving popular piety in a determined effort to stem the appeal of Protestantism. Pius began his pontificate by giving large alms to the poor, charity, and hospitals, and the pontiff was known for consoling the poor and sick and supporting missionaries.  The activities of these pontiffs coincided with a rediscovery of the ancient Christian catacombs in Rome.  As [[Diarmaid MacCulloch]] states, "Just as these ancient martyrs were revealed once more, Catholics were beginning to be martyred afresh, both in mission fields overseas and in the struggle to win back Protestant northern Europe: the catacombs proved to be an inspiration for many to action and to heroism."<ref>MacCulloch, p.404</ref>

===Council of Trent===
[[Image:Council of Trent.JPG|thumb|right|225px|The Council in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] church; Museo Diocesiano Tridentino, Trento]]

The [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563), initiated by [[Pope Paul III]], addressed issues of certain ecclesiastical corruptions such as [[simony]], [[nepotism]], and other abuses, as well as the reassertion of traditional practices and the dogmatic articulation of the traditional doctrines of the Church, such as the episcopal structure, clerical celibacy, the [[Sacraments (Catholic Church)|seven Sacraments]], [[transubstantiation]] (the belief that during mass the consecrated bread and wine truly become the body and blood of Christ), the veneration of relics, icons, and saints (especially the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]), the necessity of both faith and good works for salvation, the existence of purgatory and the issuance (but not the sale) of indulgences, etc.  In other words, all Protestant doctrinal objections and changes were uncompromisingly rejected.  The council also fostered an interest in education for parish priests to increase pastoral care. [[Milan]]'s Archbishop [[Saint Charles Borromeo|Carlo Borromeo]] set an example by visiting the remotest parishes and instilling high standards.

===Secular influence===
The monasteries also provided refuge to those sick of earthly life like [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] who retired to [[Yuste]] in his late years, and his son [[Philip II of Spain]], who was functionally as close to a monastic as his regal responsibilities permitted.

==Spread of Christianity==
The issue resulted in a crisis of conscience in 16th-century Spain.<ref name=Johansen109>Johansen, Bruce, ''The Native Peoples of North America'', Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, 2006, pp.109-110</ref><ref name="Koschorke287">Koschorke, ''A History of Christianity in Asia, Africa, and Latin America'' (2007), p. 287</ref> An outpouring of self-criticism and philosophical reflection among Catholic theologians, most notably [[Francisco de Vitoria]], led to debate on the nature of [[human rights]]<ref name="Koschorke287"/> and the birth of modern international law.<ref name="Woods137">Woods, ''How the Church Built Western Civilization'' (2005), p. 137</ref><ref name="Chadwick327">Chadwick, Owen, ''The Reformation'', Penguin, 1990, p.327</ref>

In 1521, through the leadership and preaching of the Portuguese explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]], the first Catholics were baptized in what became the first Christian nation in Southeast Asia, the [[Philippines]].<ref name="Koschorke21">Koschorke, ''A History of Christianity in Asia, Africa, and Latin America'' (2007), p. 21</ref> The following year, [[Franciscan]] missionaries arrived in what is now [[Mexico]], and sought to convert the Indians and to provide for their well-being by establishing schools and hospitals. They taught the Indians better farming methods and easier ways of weaving and making pottery. Because some people questioned whether the Indians were truly human and deserved baptism, [[Pope Paul III]] in the papal bull Veritas Ipsa or [[Sublimis Deus]] (1537) confirmed that the Indians were deserving people.<ref name=Johansen110>Johansen, Bruce, ''The Native Peoples of North America'', Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, 2006, p.110</ref><ref name="Koschorke290">Koschorke, ''A History of Christianity in Asia, Africa, and Latin America'' (2007), p. 290</ref> Afterward, the conversion effort gained momentum.<ref name=samora20>Samora ''et al.'', ''A History of the Mexican-American People'' (1993), p.20</ref>

Over the next 150&nbsp;years, the missions expanded into [[Southwestern United States|southwestern North America]].<ref name=jacksonxiv>Jackson, ''From Savages to Subjects: Missions in the History of the American Southwest'' (2000), p.14</ref> The native people were legally defined as children, and priests took on a paternalistic role, often enforced with corporal punishment.<ref name=jacksonxiii>Jackson, ''From Savages to Subjects: Missions in the History of the American Southwest'' (2000), p. 13</ref> In India, Portuguese missionaries and the Spanish Jesuit [[Francis Xavier]] evangelized among non-Christians and a Christian community which claimed to have been established by [[Thomas the Apostle]].<ref name="Koschorke3">Koschorke, ''A History of Christianity in Asia, Africa, and Latin America'' (2007), pp. 3, 17</ref>

[[Image:Whitby abbey.jpg|left|thumb|200 px|[[Whitby Abbey]] England, one of hundreds of European monasteries destroyed during the Reformation.]]

==Renaissance Church==
In Europe, the Renaissance marked a period of renewed interest in ancient and classical learning. It also brought a re-examination of accepted beliefs. Cathedrals and churches had long served as picture books and art galleries for millions of the uneducated. The stained glass windows, [[fresco]]es, statues, paintings and panels retold the stories of the saints and of biblical characters. The Church sponsored great Renaissance artists like [[Michelangelo]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who created some of the world's most famous artworks.<ref name="Duffy133">Duffy, ''Saints and Sinners'' (1997), p. 133</ref> The acceptance of humanism had its effects on the Church, which embraced it as well. In 1509, a well known scholar of the age, [[Erasmus]], wrote ''[[The Praise of Folly]]'', a work which captured a widely held unease about corruption in the Church.<ref name="Norman86">Norman, ''The Roman Catholic Church an Illustrated History'' (2007), p. 86</ref>

The Papacy was questioned by [[councilarism]] expressed in the councils of [[Council of Constance|Constance]] and the [[Council of Basel|Basel]]. Real reforms during these [[Catholic Ecumenical Councils|ecumenical councils]] and the [[Fifth Lateran Council]] were attempted several times but thwarted. They were seen as necessary but did not succeed in large measure because of internal feuds within the Church,<ref name="Franzen 65-78">Franzen 65-78</ref> ongoing conflicts with the Ottoman Empire and [[Saracen]]es<ref name="Franzen 65-78"/>  and the [[simony]] and [[nepotism]] practiced in the Renaissance Church of the 15th and early 16th centuries.<ref name="Bokenkotter202"/> As a result, rich, powerful and worldly men like Roderigo [[House of Borgia|Borgia]] ([[Pope Alexander VI]]) were able to win election to the papacy.<ref name="Bokenkotter202">Bokenkotter, ''A Concise History of the Catholic Church'' (2004), pp.201-205</ref><ref name="Duffy149">Duffy, ''Saints and Sinners'' (1997), p. 149</ref>

[[Image:Stift melk 001 2004.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|[[Melk Abbey]]&mdash;adjoining [[Wachau Valley]], [[Lower Austria]]&mdash;exemplifies the [[Baroque]] style.]]
The Council of Trent generated a revival of religious life and [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Marian devotions]] in the Roman Catholic Church. During the Reformation, the Church had defended its [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Marian beliefs]] against Protestant views. At the same time, the Catholic world was engaged in ongoing [[Ottoman Wars in Europe]] against Turkey which were fought and won under the auspices of the [[Virgin Mary]]. The victory at [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)]] was accredited to her "and signified the beginning of a strong resurgence of Marian devotions, focusing especially on Mary, the [[Queen of Heaven]] and Earth and her powerful role as [[mediatrix]] of many graces".<ref>Otto Stegmüller, Barock, in Marienkunde, 1967 566</ref> The [[Colloquium Marianum]], an elite group, and the [[Sodality of Our Lady]] based their activities on a virtuous life, free of [[Mortal sin|cardinal sins]].

== Eastern Orthodoxy ==

===Union of Brest===
The [[Uniate]] movement within East-Central Europe was started with the 1598&ndash;1599 [[Union of Brest]], by which the "Metropolia of Kiev-Halych and all Rus'" entered into relationship with the Roman Catholic Church.
The Eastern Catholic churches consider themselves to have reconciled the [[East-West Schism]] by keeping their prayers and rituals similar to those of Eastern Orthodoxy, while also accepting the primacy of the Bishop of Rome.

Some Eastern Orthodox charge that joining in this unity comes at the expense of ignoring critical doctrinal differences and past atrocities. From the perspective of many Eastern Orthodox, Eastern Catholicism is a ploy by Roman Catholicism to undermine and ultimately destroy their church by undermining its legitimacy and absorbing it into the Roman Catholic Church. It is feared that this ploy would diminish the power to the original eastern Patriarchs of the church and would require the acceptance of rejected doctrines and [[Scholasticism]] over faith.<ref>"Orthodox Kypseli" Publications -
Thessalonika, Greece - http://www.impantokratoros.gr/170832DE.en.aspx</ref><ref>[http://www.impantokratoros.gr/B8D9F008.en.aspx Atrocities of the Uniate or Unia]</ref>

===Russian Orthodox Church===
The growing might of the Russian state contributed also to the growing authority of the [[Autocephaly|autocephalous]] [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Church]]. In 1589, Metropolitan [[Patriarch Job of Moscow|Job of Moscow]] became the first [[Patriarch of Moscow and all the Rus']], making the Russian Church one of the [[pentarchy|five]] honourable [[patriarchate]]s.
