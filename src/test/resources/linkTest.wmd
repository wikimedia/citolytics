[[File:Albedo-e hg.svg|thumb|Percentage of diffusely reflected sun light in relation to various surface conditions of the Earth]]

'''Albedo''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|æ|l|ˈ|b|iː|d|oʊ}}), or ''reflection coefficient'', derived from [[Latin]] ''albedo'' &quot;whiteness&quot; (or reflected sunlight), in turn from ''albus'' &quot;white&quot;, is the [[diffuse reflection|diffuse reflectivity]] or reflecting power of a surface. It is defined as the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it. Being a [[Dimensionless number|dimensionless]] fraction, it may also be expressed as a percentage, and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflecting power of a perfectly black surface, to 1 for perfect reflection of a white surface.

Albedo depends on the [[frequency]] of the radiation. When quoted unqualified, it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. In general, the albedo depends on the directional distribution of incoming radiation.  Exceptions are [[Lambertian]] surfaces, which scatter radiation in all directions according to a cosine function, so their albedo does not depend on the incident distribution. In practice, a [[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF) may be required to characterize the scattering properties of a surface accurately, although the albedo is a very useful first approximation.

The albedo is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]], as well as in calculating [[reflectivity]] of surfaces in LEED sustainable rating systems for buildings, computer graphics and computer vision. The average overall albedo of Earth, its ''planetary albedo'', is 30 to 35%, because of the covering by clouds, but varies widely locally across the surface, depending on the geological and environmental features.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Encyclopedia, 3rd ed., Thompson Gale, 2003, ISBN 0-7876-5486-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was introduced into optics by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] in his 1760 work ''Photometria''.

Albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to 0.9 for fresh snow, to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a [[black body]]. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, while desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4.&lt;ref name=&quot;PhysicsWorld&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Albedo.html |title=Albedo - from Eric Weisstein's World of Physics |publisher=Scienceworld.wolfram.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average albedo of the [[Earth]] is about 0.3.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goode&quot; /&gt; This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult.

The classic example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature [[feedback]]. If a snow-covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.

The Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via [[Earth observation]] satellite sensors such as [[NASA]]'s [[MODIS]] instruments on board the [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] and [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellites. As the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite, a [[mathematical model]] of the BRDF is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] and bi-hemispherical reflectance.  (e.&amp;nbsp;g.,
.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA&quot; /&gt;)

The Earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the [[greenhouse effect]] is currently about 15&amp;nbsp;°C. If the Earth was frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective) the average temperature of the planet would drop below −40&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;ref name=&quot;washington&quot; /&gt; If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;ref name=&quot;clim-past&quot; /&gt;. In contrast, if all the ice on earth were to melt - a so-called aquaplanet - the average temperature on the planet would rise to just under 27&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith Robin&quot; /&gt;

===White-sky and black-sky albedo===
It has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo, the albedo at a particular solar [[Celestial coordinate system|zenith angle]] &lt;math&gt;{\theta_i}&lt;/math&gt; can reasonably be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms: the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle, &lt;math&gt;{\bar \alpha(\theta_i)}&lt;/math&gt;, and the bi-hemispherical reflectance, &lt;math&gt;\bar{ \bar \alpha}&lt;/math&gt; the proportion concerned being defined as the proportion of diffuse illumination &lt;math&gt;{D}&lt;/math&gt;.

Albedo &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; can then be given as:

:&lt;math&gt;{\alpha}= (1-D) \bar \alpha(\theta_i) + D \bar{ \bar \alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Directional-hemispherical reflectance]] is sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo and [[bi-hemispherical reflectance]] as white sky albedo. These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;BlueskyAlbedo&quot; /&gt;

==Astronomical albedo==
The albedos of [[planet]]s, [[natural satellites|satellites]] and [[asteroid]]s can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle (&quot;phase angle&quot;), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about [[regolith]] properties, while unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metallic content in [[asteroid]]s.

[[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar system, with 99% of EM radiation reflected. Another notable high-albedo body is [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], with an albedo of 0.96
